0,Calculation of prompt diphoton production cross sections at Tevatron and   LHC energies,"C. Bal\'azs, E. L. Berger, P. M. Nadolsky, C.-P. Yuan","  A fully differential calculation in perturbative quantum chromodynamics is presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark, gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious selection of events.

1,Sparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions,Ileana Streinu and Louis Theran,"  We describe a new algorithm, the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors, and use it obtain a characterization of the family of $(k,\ell)$-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concerning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have received increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen the previous results of Lee and Streinu and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characterization of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the $(k,\ell)$-pebble game with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous sparse graph algorithms by Gabow, Gabow and Westermann and Hendrickson. "
2,The evolution of the Earth-Moon system based on the dark matter field   fluid model,Hongjun Pan,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004, American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5 billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2). "
3,A determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic   single-source automata,David Callan,  We show that a determinant of Stirling cycle numbers counts unlabeled acyclic single-source automata. The proof involves a bijection from these automata to certain marked lattice paths and a sign-reversing involution to evaluate the determinant. 
4,From dyadic $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ to $\Lambda_{\alpha}$,Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky,"  In this paper we show how to compute the $\Lambda_{\alpha}$ norm, $\alpha\ge 0$, using the dyadic grid. This result is a consequence of the description of the Hardy spaces $H^p(R^N)$ in terms of dyadic and special atoms. "
5,Bosonic characters of atomic Cooper pairs across resonance,Y. H. Pong and C. K. Law,"  We study the two-particle wave function of paired atoms in a Fermi gas with tunable interaction strengths controlled by Feshbach resonance. The Cooper pair wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates. "
6,Polymer Quantum Mechanics and its Continuum Limit,"Alejandro Corichi, Tatjana Vukasinac and Jose A. Zapata","  A rather non-standard quantum representation of the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics systems, known as the polymer representation has gained some attention in recent years, due to its possible relation with Planck scale physics. In particular, this approach has been followed in a symmetric sector of loop quantum gravity known as loop quantum cosmology. Here we explore different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and the polymer description. The paper has two parts. In the first one, we derive the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple cosmological model. "
7,Numerical solution of shock and ramp compression for general material   properties,Damian C. Swift,"  A general formulation was developed to represent material models for applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.

8,"The Spitzer c2d Survey of Large, Nearby, Insterstellar Clouds. IX. The   Serpens YSO Population As Observed With IRAC and MIPS","Paul Harvey, Bruno Merin, Tracy L. Huard, Luisa M. Rebull, Nicholas   Chapman, Neal J. Evans II, Philip C. Myers","  We discuss the results from the combined IRAC and MIPS c2d Spitzer Legacy observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc. The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities. A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO population and our Spitzer data set. "
9,"Partial cubes: structures, characterizations, and constructions",Sergei Ovchinnikov,"  Partial cubes are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes. Structures on a graph defined by means of semicubes, and Djokovi\'{c}'s and Winkler's relations play an important role in the theory of partial cubes. These structures are employed in the paper to characterize bipartite graphs and partial cubes of arbitrary dimension. New characterizations are established and new proofs of some known results are given.   The operations of Cartesian product and pasting, and expansion and contraction processes are utilized in the paper to construct new partial cubes from old ones. In particular, the isometric and lattice dimensions of finite partial cubes obtained by means of these operations are calculated. "
10,Computing genus 2 Hilbert-Siegel modular forms over $\Q(\sqrt{5})$ via   the Jacquet-Langlands correspondence,Clifton Cunningham and Lassina Dembele,"  In this paper we present an algorithm for computing Hecke eigensystems of Hilbert-Siegel cusp forms over real quadratic fields of narrow class number one. We give some illustrative examples using the quadratic field $\Q(\sqrt{5})$. In those examples, we identify Hilbert-Siegel eigenforms that are possible lifts from Hilbert eigenforms. "
11,Distribution of integral Fourier Coefficients of a Modular Form of Half   Integral Weight Modulo Primes,Dohoon Choi,"  Recently, Bruinier and Ono classified cusp forms $f(z) := \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_f(n)q ^n \in S_{\lambda+1/2}(\Gamma_0(N),\chi)\cap \mathbb{Z}[[q]]$ that does not satisfy a certain distribution property for modulo odd primes $p$. In this paper, using Rankin-Cohen Bracket, we extend this result to modular forms of half integral weight for primes $p \geq 5$. As applications of our main theorem we derive distribution properties, for modulo primes $p\geq5$, of traces of singular moduli and Hurwitz class number. We also study an analogue of Newman's conjecture for overpartitions. "
12,$p$-adic Limit of Weakly Holomorphic Modular Forms of Half Integral   Weight,Dohoon Choi and YoungJu Choie,"  Serre obtained the p-adic limit of the integral Fourier coefficient of modular forms on $SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$ for $p=2,3,5,7$. In this paper, we extend the result of Serre to weakly holomorphic modular forms of half integral weight on $\Gamma_{0}(4N)$ for $N=1,2,4$. A proof is based on linear relations among Fourier coefficients of modular forms of half integral weight. As applications we obtain congruences of Borcherds exponents, congruences of quotient of Eisentein series and congruences of values of $L$-functions at a certain point are also studied. Furthermore, the congruences of the Fourier coefficients of Siegel modular forms on Maass Space are obtained using Ikeda lifting. "
13,Iterated integral and the loop product,Koichi Fujii,  In this article we discuss a relation between the string topology and differential forms based on the theory of Chen's iterated integrals and the cyclic bar complex. 
14,Fermionic superstring loop amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism,Christian Stahn,"  The pure spinor formulation of the ten-dimensional superstring leads to manifestly supersymmetric loop amplitudes, expressed as integrals in pure spinor superspace. This paper explores different methods to evaluate these integrals and then uses them to calculate the kinematic factors of the one-loop and two-loop massless four-point amplitudes involving two and four Ramond states. "
15,Lifetime of doubly charmed baryons,"Chao-Hsi Chang, Tong Li, Xue-Qian Li and Yu-Ming Wang","  In this work, we evaluate the lifetimes of the doubly charmed baryons $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$. We carefully calculate the non-spectator contributions at the quark level where the Cabibbo-suppressed diagrams are also included. The hadronic matrix elements are evaluated in the simple non-relativistic harmonic oscillator model. Our numerical results are generally consistent with that obtained by other authors who used the diquark model. However, all the theoretical predictions on the lifetimes are one order larger than the upper limit set by the recent SELEX measurement. This discrepancy would be clarified by the future experiment, if more accurate experiment still confirms the value of the SELEX collaboration, there must be some unknown mechanism to be explored. "
16,Spectroscopic Observations of the Intermediate Polar EX Hydrae in   Quiescence,"Nceba Mhlahlo, David H. Buckley, Vikram S. Dhillon, Steven B. Potter,   Brian Warner and Patric A. Woudt","  Results from spectroscopic observations of the Intermediate Polar (IP) EX Hya in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600 km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed, confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the accretion curtain model. "
17,In quest of a generalized Callias index theorem,Andreas Gustavsson,"  We give a prescription for how to compute the Callias index, using as regulator an exponential function. We find agreement with old results in all odd dimensions. We show that the problem of computing the dimension of the moduli space of self-dual strings can be formulated as an index problem in even-dimensional (loop-)space. We think that the regulator used in this Letter can be applied to this index problem. "
18,"Approximation for extinction probability of the contact process based on   the Gr\""obner basis",Norio Konno,"  In this note we give a new method for getting a series of approximations for the extinction probability of the one-dimensional contact process by using the Gr\""obner basis. "
19,Measurement of the Hadronic Form Factor in D0 --> K- e+ nue Decays,"The BABAR Collaboration, B. Aubert, et al","  The shape of the hadronic form factor f+(q2) in the decay D0 --> K- e+ nue has been measured in a model independent analysis and compared with theoretical calculations. We use 75 fb(-1) of data recorded by the BABAR detector at the PEPII electron-positron collider. The corresponding decay branching fraction, relative to the decay D0 --> K- pi+, has also been measured to be RD = BR(D0 --> K- e+ nue)/BR(D0 --> K- pi+) = 0.927 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.012. From these results, and using the present world average value for BR(D0 --> K- pi+), the normalization of the form factor at q2=0 is determined to be f+(0)=0.727 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.007 where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic, and from external inputs, respectively. "
20,Molecular Synchronization Waves in Arrays of Allosterically Regulated   Enzymes,"Vanessa Casagrande, Yuichi Togashi, Alexander S. Mikhailov",  Spatiotemporal pattern formation in a product-activated enzymic reaction at high enzyme concentrations is investigated. Stochastic simulations show that catalytic turnover cycles of individual enzymes can become coherent and that complex wave patterns of molecular synchronization can develop. The analysis based on the mean-field approximation indicates that the observed patterns result from the presence of Hopf and wave bifurcations in the considered system. 
21,Stochastic Lie group integrators,Simon J.A. Malham and Anke Wiese,"  We present Lie group integrators for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth finite dimensional manifold. Given a Lie group action that generates transport along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes. Lastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid body such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by two independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes. "
22,ALMA as the ideal probe of the solar chromosphere,"M. A. Loukitcheva, S. K. Solanki and S. White","  The very nature of the solar chromosphere, its structuring and dynamics, remains far from being properly understood, in spite of intensive research. Here we point out the potential of chromospheric observations at millimeter wavelengths to resolve this long-standing problem. Computations carried out with a sophisticated dynamic model of the solar chromosphere due to Carlsson and Stein demonstrate that millimeter emission is extremely sensitive to dynamic processes in the chromosphere and the appropriate wavelengths to look for dynamic signatures are in the range 0.8-5.0 mm. The model also suggests that high resolution observations at mm wavelengths, as will be provided by ALMA, will have the unique property of reacting to both the hot and the cool gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8 mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of the comprehensive dynamic simulations. "
23,Formation of quasi-solitons in transverse confined ferromagnetic film   media,"A.A. Serga, M. Kostylev, and B. Hillebrands","  The formation of quasi-2D spin-wave waveforms in longitudinally magnetized stripes of ferrimagnetic film was observed by using time- and space-resolved Brillouin light scattering technique. In the linear regime it was found that the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the lateral stripe edges. Thus, the so-called effective dipolar pinning of dynamic magnetization takes place at the edges.   In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the shape of the formed waveforms and their behavior are strongly influenced by the confinement. "
24,Spectroscopic Properties of Polarons in Strongly Correlated Systems by   Exact Diagrammatic Monte Carlo Method,"A. S. Mishchenko (1 and 2) and N. Nagaosa (1 and 3) ((1) CREST, Japan   Science and Technology Agency, (2) Russian Research Centre ``Kurchatov   Institute'', (3) The University of Tokyo)","  We present recent advances in understanding of the ground and excited states of the electron-phonon coupled systems obtained by novel methods of Diagrammatic Monte Carlo and Stochastic Optimization, which enable the approximation-free calculation of Matsubara Green function in imaginary times and perform unbiased analytic continuation to real frequencies. We present exact numeric results on the ground state properties, Lehmann spectral function and optical conductivity of different strongly correlated systems: Frohlich polaron, Rashba-Pekar exciton-polaron, pseudo Jahn-Teller polaron, exciton, and interacting with phonons hole in the t-J model. "
25,"Placeholder Substructures II: Meta-Fractals, Made of Box-Kites, Fill   Infinite-Dimensional Skies",Robert P. C. de Marrais,"  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes"" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity. "
26,Filling-Factor-Dependent Magnetophonon Resonance in Graphene,"M. O. Goerbig, J.-N. Fuchs, K. Kechedzhi, Vladimir I. Fal'ko","  We describe a peculiar fine structure acquired by the in-plane optical phonon at the Gamma-point in graphene when it is brought into resonance with one of the inter-Landau-level transitions in this material. The effect is most pronounced when this lattice mode (associated with the G-band in graphene Raman spectrum) is in resonance with inter-Landau-level transitions 0 -> (+,1) and (-,1) -> 0, at a magnetic field B_0 ~ 30 T. It can be used to measure the strength of the electron-phonon coupling directly, and its filling-factor dependence can be used experimentally to detect circularly polarized lattice modes. "
27,"Pfaffians, hafnians and products of real linear functionals",P\'eter E. Frenkel,  We prove pfaffian and hafnian versions of Lieb's inequalities on determinants and permanents of positive semi-definite matrices. We use the hafnian inequality to improve the lower bound of R\'ev\'esz and Sarantopoulos on the norm of a product of linear functionals on a real Euclidean space (this subject is sometimes called the `real linear polarization constant' problem). 
28,Understanding the Flavor Symmetry Breaking and Nucleon Flavor-Spin   Structure within Chiral Quark Model,"Zhan Shu, Xiao-Lin Chen and Wei-Zhen Deng","  In $\XQM$, a quark can emit Goldstone bosons. The flavor symmetry breaking in the Goldstone boson emission process is used to intepret the nucleon flavor-spin structure. In this paper, we study the inner structure of constituent quarks implied in $\XQM$ caused by the Goldstone boson emission process in nucleon. From a simplified model Hamiltonian derived from $\XQM$, the intrinsic wave functions of constituent quarks are determined. Then the obtained transition probabilities of the emission of Goldstone boson from a quark can give a reasonable interpretation to the flavor symmetry breaking in nucleon flavor-spin structure. "
29,Tuning correlation effects with electron-phonon interactions,J.P.Hague and N.d'Ambrumenil,"  We investigate the effect of tuning the phonon energy on the correlation effects in models of electron-phonon interactions using DMFT. In the regime where itinerant electrons, instantaneous electron-phonon driven correlations and static distortions compete on similar energy scales, we find several interesting results including (1) A crossover from band to Mott behavior in the spectral function, leading to hybrid band/Mott features in the spectral function for phonon frequencies slightly larger than the band width. (2) Since the optical conductivity depends sensitively on the form of the spectral function, we show that such a regime should be observable through the low frequency form of the optical conductivity. (3) The resistivity has a double kondo peak arrangement "
30,Crystal channeling of LHC forward protons with preserved distribution in   phase space,"V. M. Biryukov (Serpukhov, IHEP)","  We show that crystal can trap a broad (x, x', y, y', E) distribution of particles and channel it preserved with a high precision. This sampled-and-hold distribution can be steered by a bent crystal for analysis downstream. In simulations for the 7 TeV Large Hadron Collider, a crystal adapted to the accelerator lattice traps 90% of diffractively scattered protons emerging from the interaction point with a divergence 100 times the critical angle. We set the criterion for crystal adaptation improving efficiency ~100-fold. Proton angles are preserved in crystal transmission with accuracy down to 0.1 microrad. This makes feasible a crystal application for measuring very forward protons at the LHC. "
31,Probing non-standard neutrino interactions with supernova neutrinos,"A. Esteban-Pretel, R. Tom\`as and J. W. F. Valle","  We analyze the possibility of probing non-standard neutrino interactions (NSI, for short) through the detection of neutrinos produced in a future galactic supernova (SN).We consider the effect of NSI on the neutrino propagation through the SN envelope within a three-neutrino framework, paying special attention to the inclusion of NSI-induced resonant conversions, which may take place in the most deleptonised inner layers. We study the possibility of detecting NSI effects in a Megaton water Cherenkov detector, either through modulation effects in the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum due to (i) the passage of shock waves through the SN envelope, (ii) the time dependence of the electron fraction and (iii) the Earth matter effects; or, finally, through the possible detectability of the neutronization $\nu_e$ burst. We find that the $\bar\nu_e$ spectrum can exhibit dramatic features due to the internal NSI-induced resonant conversion. This occurs for non-universal NSI strengths of a few %, and for very small flavor-changing NSI above a few$\times 10^{-5}$. "
32,Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. I. Theoretical   analysis,"Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  We performed a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). We prove that errors in any measured quantity are bounded by a sum of a linear and quadratic term in the size of a dipole d, when the latter is in the range of DDA applicability. Moreover, the linear term is significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers. Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence. "
33,Origin of adaptive mutants: a quantum measurement?,Vasily Ogryzko,"  This is a supplement to the paper arXiv:q-bio/0701050, containing the text of correspondence sent to Nature in 1990. "
34,Convergence of the discrete dipole approximation. II. An extrapolation   technique to increase the accuracy,"Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  We propose an extrapolation technique that allows accuracy improvement of the discrete dipole approximation computations. The performance of this technique was studied empirically based on extensive simulations for 5 test cases using many different discretizations. The quality of the extrapolation improves with refining discretization reaching extraordinary performance especially for cubically shaped particles. A two order of magnitude decrease of error was demonstrated. We also propose estimates of the extrapolation error, which were proven to be reliable. Finally we propose a simple method to directly separate shape and discretization errors and illustrated this for one test case. "
35,A remark on the number of steady states in a multiple futile cycle,Liming Wang and Eduardo D. Sontag,"  The multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is a motif repeatedly used in cell signaling. This motif itself can generate a variety of dynamic behaviors like bistability and ultrasensitivity without direct positive feedbacks. In this paper, we study the number of positive steady states of a general multisite phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, and how the number of positive steady states varies by changing the biological parameters. We show analytically that (1) for some parameter ranges, there are at least n+1 (if n is even) or n (if n is odd) steady states; (2) there never are more than 2n-1 steady states (in particular, this implies that for n=2, including single levels of MAPK cascades, there are at most three steady states); (3) for parameters near the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there are at most n+1 steady states; and (4) for parameters far from the standard Michaelis-Menten quasi-steady state conditions, there is at most one steady state. "
36,The discrete dipole approximation for simulation of light scattering by   particles much larger than the wavelength,"Maxim A. Yurkin, Valeri P. Maltsev, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  In this manuscript we investigate the capabilities of the Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) to simulate scattering from particles that are much larger than the wavelength of the incident light, and describe an optimized publicly available DDA computer program that processes the large number of dipoles required for such simulations. Numerical simulations of light scattering by spheres with size parameters x up to 160 and 40 for refractive index m=1.05 and 2 respectively are presented and compared with exact results of the Mie theory. Errors of both integral and angle-resolved scattering quantities generally increase with m and show no systematic dependence on x. Computational times increase steeply with both x and m, reaching values of more than 2 weeks on a cluster of 64 processors. The main distinctive feature of the computer program is the ability to parallelize a single DDA simulation over a cluster of computers, which allows it to simulate light scattering by very large particles, like the ones that are considered in this manuscript. Current limitations and possible ways for improvement are discussed. "
37,The discrete dipole approximation: an overview and recent developments,"Maxim A. Yurkin, Alfons G. Hoekstra","  We present a review of the discrete dipole approximation (DDA), which is a general method to simulate light scattering by arbitrarily shaped particles. We put the method in historical context and discuss recent developments, taking the viewpoint of a general framework based on the integral equations for the electric field. We review both the theory of the DDA and its numerical aspects, the latter being of critical importance for any practical application of the method. Finally, the position of the DDA among other methods of light scattering simulation is shown and possible future developments are discussed. "
38,Scalar radius of the pion and zeros in the form factor,Jose A. Oller and Luis Roca,"  The quadratic pion scalar radius, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s, plays an important role for present precise determinations of \pi\pi scattering. Recently, Yndur\'ain, using an Omn\`es representation of the null isospin(I) non-strange pion scalar form factor, obtains \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.75\pm 0.07 fm^2. This value is larger than the one calculated by solving the corresponding Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es equations, \la r^2\ra^\pi_s=0.61\pm 0.04 fm^2. A large discrepancy between both values, given the precision, then results. We reanalyze Yndur\'ain's method and show that by imposing continuity of the resulting pion scalar form factor under tiny changes in the input \pi\pi phase shifts, a zero in the form factor for some S-wave I=0 T-matrices is then required. Once this is accounted for, the resulting value is \la r^2\ra_s^\pi=0.65\pm 0.05 fm^2. The main source of error in our determination is present experimental uncertainties in low energy S-wave I=0 \pi\pi phase shifts. Another important contribution to our error is the not yet settled asymptotic behaviour of the phase of the scalar form factor from QCD. "
39,Multilinear function series in conditionally free probability with   amalgamation,Mihai Popa,"  As in the cases of freeness and monotonic independence, the notion of conditional freeness is meaningful when complex-valued states are replaced by positive conditional expectations. In this framework, the paper presents several positivity results, a version of the central limit theorem and an analogue of the conditionally free R-transform constructed by means of multilinear function series. "
40,Quantum Group of Isometries in Classical and Noncommutative Geometry,Debashish Goswami,"  We formulate a quantum generalization of the notion of the group of Riemannian isometries for a compact Riemannian manifold, by introducing a natural notion of smooth and isometric action by a compact quantum group on a classical or noncommutative manifold described by spectral triples, and then proving the existence of a universal object (called the quantum isometry group) in the category of compact quantum groups acting smoothly and isometrically on a given (possibly noncommutative) manifold satisfying certain regularity assumptions. In fact, we identify the quantum isometry group with the universal object in a bigger category, namely the category of `quantum families of smooth isometries', defined along the line of Woronowicz and Soltan. We also construct a spectral triple on the Hilbert space of forms on a noncommutative manifold which is equivariant with respect to a natural unitary representation of the quantum isometry group. We give explicit description of quantum isometry groups of commutative and noncommutative tori, and in this context, obtain the quantum double torus defined in \cite{hajac} as the universal quantum group of holomorphic isometries of the noncommutative torus.

41,"General System theory, Like-Quantum Semantics and Fuzzy Sets",Ignazio Licata,  It is outlined the possibility to extend the quantum formalism in relation to the requirements of the general systems theory. It can be done by using a quantum semantics arising from the deep logical structure of quantum theory. It is so possible taking into account the logical openness relationship between observer and system. We are going to show how considering the truth-values of quantum propositions within the context of the fuzzy sets is here more useful for systemics . In conclusion we propose an example of formal quantum coherence. 
42,Nonequilibrium entropy limiters in lattice Boltzmann methods,"R.A. Brownlee, A.N. Gorban, J. Levesley","  We construct a system of nonequilibrium entropy limiters for the lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM). These limiters erase spurious oscillations without blurring of shocks, and do not affect smooth solutions. In general, they do the same work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes and finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction of nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar quantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i) based on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy ""trimming"") and (ii) based on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical properties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples: 1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid. All limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic quasiequilibria. "
43,Astrophysical gyrokinetics: kinetic and fluid turbulent cascades in   magnetized weakly collisional plasmas,"A. A. Schekochihin (Oxford), S. C. Cowley (Culham), W. Dorland   (Maryland), G. W. Hammett (Princeton), G. G. Howes (Iowa), E. Quataert   (Berkeley), T. Tatsuno (Maryland)","  We present a theoretical framework for plasma turbulence in astrophysical plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks). The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations, which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave (KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical applications are discussed in detail. "
44,Evolution of solitary waves and undular bores in shallow-water flows   over a gradual slope with bottom friction,"G.A. El, R.H.J. Grimshaw, A.M. Kamchatnov","  This paper considers the propagation of shallow-water solitary and nonlinear periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.

45,A limit relation for entropy and channel capacity per unit cost,"I. Csiszar, F. Hiai and D. Petz","  In a quantum mechanical model, Diosi, Feldmann and Kosloff arrived at a conjecture stating that the limit of the entropy of certain mixtures is the relative entropy as system size goes to infinity. The conjecture is proven in this paper for density matrices. The first proof is analytic and uses the quantum law of large numbers. The second one clarifies the relation to channel capacity per unit cost for classical-quantum channels. Both proofs lead to generalization of the conjecture. "
46,Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part I,T. Kosel and I. Grabec,"  The intelligent acoustic emission locator is described in Part I, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two simultaneously active continuous acoustic emission sources.   The location of acoustic emission on complicated aircraft frame structures is a difficult problem of non-destructive testing. This article describes an intelligent acoustic emission source locator. The intelligent locator comprises a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by the acoustic emission method. "
47,Inference on white dwarf binary systems using the first round Mock LISA   Data Challenges data sets,"Alexander Stroeer, John Veitch, Christian Roever, Ed Bloomer, James   Clark, Nelson Christensen, Martin Hendry, Chris Messenger, Renate Meyer,   Matthew Pitkin, Jennifer Toher, Richard Umstaetter, Alberto Vecchio and   Graham Woan","  We report on the analysis of selected single source data sets from the first round of the Mock LISA Data Challenges (MLDC) for white dwarf binaries. We implemented an end-to-end pipeline consisting of a grid-based coherent pre-processing unit for signal detection, and an automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo post-processing unit for signal evaluation. We demonstrate that signal detection with our coherent approach is secure and accurate, and is increased in accuracy and supplemented with additional information on the signal parameters by our Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. We also demonstrate that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo routine is additionally able to determine accurately the noise level in the frequency window of interest. "
48,An algorithm for the classification of smooth Fano polytopes,Mikkel {\O}bro,"  We present an algorithm that produces the classification list of smooth Fano d-polytopes for any given d. The input of the algorithm is a single number, namely the positive integer d. The algorithm has been used to classify smooth Fano d-polytopes for d<=7. There are 7622 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 6-polytopes and 72256 isomorphism classes of smooth Fano 7-polytopes. "
49,Intelligent location of simultaneously active acoustic emission sources:   Part II,T. Kosel and I. Grabec,"  Part I describes an intelligent acoustic emission locator, while Part II discusses blind source separation, time delay estimation and location of two continuous acoustic emission sources.   Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission analysis. "
50,Visualizing Teleportation,Scott M. Cohen,"  A novel way of picturing the processing of quantum information is described, allowing a direct visualization of teleportation of quantum states and providing a simple and intuitive understanding of this fascinating phenomenon. The discussion is aimed at providing physicists a method of explaining teleportation to non-scientists. The basic ideas of quantum physics are first explained in lay terms, after which these ideas are used with a graphical description, out of which teleportation arises naturally. "
51,Quantum Field Theory on Curved Backgrounds. II. Spacetime Symmetries,Arthur Jaffe (1) and Gordon Ritter (1) ((1) Harvard University),"  We study space-time symmetries in scalar quantum field theory (including interacting theories) on static space-times. We first consider Euclidean quantum field theory on a static Riemannian manifold, and show that the isometry group is generated by one-parameter subgroups which have either self-adjoint or unitary quantizations. We analytically continue the self-adjoint semigroups to one-parameter unitary groups, and thus construct a unitary representation of the isometry group of the associated Lorentzian manifold. The method is illustrated for the example of hyperbolic space, whose Lorentzian continuation is Anti-de Sitter space. "
52,A Global Approach to the Theory of Special Finsler Manifolds,"Nabil L. Youssef, S. H. Abed and A. Soleiman","  The aim of the present paper is to provide a global presentation of the theory of special Finsler manifolds. We introduce and investigate globally (or intrinsically, free from local coordinates) many of the most important and most commonly used special Finsler manifolds: locally Minkowskian, Berwald, Landesberg, general Landesberg, $P$-reducible, $C$-reducible, semi-$C$-reducible, quasi-$C$-reducible, $P^{*}$-Finsler, $C^{h}$-recurrent, $C^{v}$-recurrent, $C^{0}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent, $S^{v}$-recurrent of the second order, $C_{2}$-like, $S_{3}$-like, $S_{4}$-like, $P_{2}$-like, $R_{3}$-like, $P$-symmetric, $h$-isotropic, of scalar curvature, of constant curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special Finsler spaces considered. "
53,"The Hardy-Lorentz Spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$",Wael Abu-Shammala and Alberto Torchinsky,"  In this paper we consider the Hardy-Lorentz spaces $H^{p,q}(R^n)$, with $0<p\le 1$, $0<q\le \infty$. We discuss the atomic decomposition of the elements in these spaces, their interpolation properties, and the behavior of singular integrals and other operators acting on them. "
54,Potassium intercalation in graphite: A van der Waals density-functional   study,"Eleni Ziambaras, Jesper Kleis, Elsebeth Schroder, and Per Hyldgaard","  Potassium intercalation in graphite is investigated by first-principles theory. The bonding in the potassium-graphite compound is reasonably well accounted for by traditional semilocal density functional theory (DFT) calculations. However, to investigate the intercalate formation energy from pure potassium atoms and graphite requires use of a description of the graphite interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal approach, is found to weakly soften the elastic response. "
55,Phase diagram of Gaussian-core nematics,Santi Prestipino and Franz Saija,"  We study a simple model of a nematic liquid crystal made of parallel ellipsoidal particles interacting via a repulsive Gaussian law. After identifying the relevant solid phases of the system through a careful zero-temperature scrutiny of as many as eleven candidate crystal structures, we determine the melting temperature for various pressure values, also with the help of exact free energy calculations. Among the prominent features of this model are pressure-driven reentrant melting and the stabilization of a columnar phase for intermediate temperatures. "
56,High-spin to low-spin and orbital polarization transitions in   multiorbital Mott systems,Philipp Werner and Andrew J. Millis,"  We study the interplay of crystal field splitting and Hund coupling in a two-orbital model which captures the essential physics of systems with two electrons or holes in the e_g shell. We use single site dynamical mean field theory with a recently developed impurity solver which is able to access strong couplings and low temperatures. The fillings of the orbitals and the location of phase boundaries are computed as a function of Coulomb repulsion, exchange coupling and crystal field splitting. We find that the Hund coupling can drive the system into a novel Mott insulating phase with vanishing orbital susceptibility. Away from half-filling, the crystal field splitting can induce an orbital selective Mott state. "
57,Intelligent Life in Cosmology,Frank J. Tipler,"  I shall present three arguments for the proposition that intelligent life is very rare in the universe. First, I shall summarize the consensus opinion of the founders of the Modern Synthesis (Simpson, Dobzhanski, and Mayr) that the evolution of intelligent life is exceedingly improbable. Second, I shall develop the Fermi Paradox: if they existed they'd be here. Third, I shall show that if intelligent life were too common, it would use up all available resources and die out. But I shall show that the quantum mechanical principle of unitarity (actually a form of teleology!) requires intelligent life to survive to the end of time. Finally, I shall argue that, if the universe is indeed accelerating, then survival to the end of time requires that intelligent life, though rare, to have evolved several times in the visible universe. I shall argue that the acceleration is a consequence of the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. I shall suggest experiments to test these claims. "
58,The Mass and Radius of the Unseen M-Dwarf Companion in the Single-Lined   Eclipsing Binary HAT-TR-205-013,"T. G. Beatty, J. M. Fernandez, D. W. Latham, G. A. Bakos, G. Kovacs,   R. W. Noyes, R. P. Stefanik, G. Torres, M. E. Everett, C. W. Hergenrother","  We derive masses and radii for both components in the single-lined eclipsing binary HAT-TR-205-013, which consists of a F7V primary and a late M-dwarf secondary. The system's period is short, $P=2.230736 \pm 0.000010$ days, with an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU. Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04 \pm 0.13$ \msun. Our result for HAT-TR-205-013 B lies above the theoretical mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation. "
59,Coulomb excitation of unstable nuclei at intermediate energies,"C.A. Bertulani, G. Cardella, M. De Napoli, G. Raciti, and E. Rapisarda","  We investigate the Coulomb excitation of low-lying states of unstable nuclei in intermediate energy collisions ($E_{lab}\sim10-500$ MeV/nucleon). It is shown that the cross sections for the $E1$ and $E2$ transitions are larger at lower energies, much less than 10 MeV/nucleon. Retardation effects and Coulomb distortion are found to be both relevant for energies as low as 10 MeV/nucleon and as high as 500 MeV/nucleon. Implications for studies at radioactive beam facilities are discussed. "
60,Intersection Bodies and Generalized Cosine Transforms,Boris Rubin,"  Intersection bodies represent a remarkable class of geometric objects associated with sections of star bodies and invoking   Radon transforms, generalized cosine transforms, and the relevant Fourier analysis. The main focus of this article is interrelation between generalized cosine transforms of different kinds in the context of their application to investigation of a certain family of intersection bodies, which we call $\lam$-intersection bodies. The latter include $k$-intersection bodies (in the sense of A. Koldobsky) and unit balls of finite-dimensional subspaces of $L_p$-spaces. In particular, we show that restrictions onto lower dimensional subspaces of the spherical Radon transforms and the generalized cosine transforms preserve their integral-geometric structure. We apply this result to the study of sections of $\lam$-intersection bodies. New characterizations of this class of bodies are obtained and examples are given. We also review some known facts and give them new proofs. "
61,On-line Viterbi Algorithm and Its Relationship to Random Walks,"Rastislav \v{S}r\'amek, Bro\v{n}a Brejov\'a, Tom\'a\v{s} Vina\v{r}","  In this paper, we introduce the on-line Viterbi algorithm for decoding hidden Markov models (HMMs) in much smaller than linear space. Our analysis on two-state HMMs suggests that the expected maximum memory used to decode sequence of length $n$ with $m$-state HMM can be as low as $\Theta(m\log n)$, without a significant slow-down compared to the classical Viterbi algorithm. Classical Viterbi algorithm requires $O(mn)$ space, which is impractical for analysis of long DNA sequences (such as complete human genome chromosomes) and for continuous data streams. We also experimentally demonstrate the performance of the on-line Viterbi algorithm on a simple HMM for gene finding on both simulated and real DNA sequences. "
62,Experimental efforts in search of 76Ge Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay,Somnath Choudhury,"  Neutrinoless double beta decay is one of the most sensitive approaches in non-accelerator particle physics to take us into a regime of physics beyond the standard model. This article is a brief review of the experiments in search of neutrinoless double beta decay from 76Ge. Following a brief introduction of the process of double beta decay from 76Ge, the results of the very first experiments IGEX and Heidelberg-Moscow which give indications of the existence of possible neutrinoless double beta decay mode has been reviewed. Then ongoing efforts to substantiate the early findings are presented and the Majorana experiment as a future experimental approach which will allow a very detailed study of the neutrinoless decay mode is discussed. "
63,Nilpotent symmetry invariance in the superfield formulation: the   (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories,R. P. Malik (Bhu),"  We capture the off-shell as well as the on-shell nilpotent Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) and anti-BRST symmetry invariance of the Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories within the framework of the superfield formalism. In particular, we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism. Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu = 0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry invariance. "
64,Littlewood-Richardson polynomials,A. I. Molev,  We introduce a family of rings of symmetric functions depending on an infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A. Okounkov and G. Olshanski. 
65,Lagrangian quantum field theory in momentum picture. IV. Commutation   relations for free fields,"Bozhidar Z. Iliev (Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy,   Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria)","  Possible (algebraic) commutation relations in the Lagrangian quantum theory of free (scalar, spinor and vector) fields are considered from mathematical view-point. As sources of these relations are employed the Heisenberg equations/relations for the dynamical variables and a specific condition for uniqueness of the operators of the dynamical variables (with respect to some class of Lagrangians). The paracommutation relations or some their generalizations are pointed as the most general ones that entail the validity of all Heisenberg equations. The simultaneous fulfillment of the Heisenberg equations and the uniqueness requirement turn to be impossible. This problem is solved via a redefinition of the dynamical variables, similar to the normal ordering procedure and containing it as a special case. That implies corresponding changes in the admissible commutation relations. The introduction of the concept of the vacuum makes narrow the class of the possible commutation relations; in particular, the mentioned redefinition of the dynamical variables is reduced to normal ordering. As a last restriction on that class is imposed the requirement for existing of an effective procedure for calculating vacuum mean values. The standard bilinear commutation relations are pointed as the only known ones that satisfy all of the mentioned conditions and do not contradict to the existing data. "
66,Order of Epitaxial Self-Assembled Quantum Dots: Linear Analysis,Lawrence H. Friedman,"  Epitaxial self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) are of interest for nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers, photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented. "
67,A Note About the {Ki(z)} Functions,Branko J. Malesevic,"  In the article [Petojevic 2006], A. Petojevi\' c verified useful properties of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions which generalize Kurepa's [Kurepa 1971] left factorial function. In this note, we present simplified proofs of two of these results and we answer the open question stated in [Petojevic 2006]. Finally, we discuss the differential transcendency of the $K_{i}(z)$ functions. "
68,Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,John W. Robertson,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the smooth and holomorphic setting. "
69,Coincidence of the oscillations in the dipole transition and in the   persistent current of narrow quantum rings with two electrons,He Yanzhang and Bao Chengguang,"  The fractional Aharonov-Bohm oscillation (FABO) of narrow quantum rings with two electrons has been studied and has been explained in an analytical way, the evolution of the period and amplitudes against the magnetic field can be exactly described. Furthermore, the dipole transition of the ground state was found to have essentially two frequencies, their difference appears as an oscillation matching the oscillation of the persistent current exactly. A number of equalities relating the observables and dynamical parameters have been found. "

71,The decomposition method and Maple procedure for finding first integrals   of nonlinear PDEs of any order with any number of independent variables,Yu.N. Kosovtsov,"  In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders. It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s), each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE. Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its highest derivatives.   The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs. "
72,A transcendental approach to Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem,Osamu Fujino,"  We treat Koll\'ar's injectivity theorem from the analytic (or differential geometric) viewpoint. More precisely, we give a curvature condition which implies Koll\'ar type cohomology injectivity theorems. Our main theorem is formulated for a compact K\""ahler manifold, but the proof uses the space of harmonic forms on a Zariski open set with a suitable complete K\""ahler metric. We need neither covering tricks, desingularizations, nor Leray's spectral sequence. "
73,Injective Morita contexts (revisited),"J. Y. Abuhlail, S. K. Nauman","  This paper is an exposition of the so-called injective Morita contexts (in which the connecting bimodule morphisms are injective) and Morita $\alpha$contexts (in which the connecting bimodules enjoy some local projectivity in the sense of Zimmermann-Huisgen). Motivated by situations in which only one trace ideal is in action, or the compatibility between the bimodule morphisms is not needed, we introduce the notions of Morita semi-contexts and Morita data, and investigate them. Injective Morita data will be used (with the help of static and adstatic modules) to establish equivalences between some intersecting subcategories related to subcategories of modules that are localized or colocalized by trace ideals of a Morita datum. We end up with applications of Morita $\alpha$-contexts to $\ast$-modules and injective right wide Morita contexts. "
74,Strong decays of charmed baryons,"Chong Chen, Xiao-Lin Chen, Xiang Liu, Wei-Zhen Deng and Shi-Lin Zhu","  There has been important experimental progress in the sector of heavy baryons in the past several years. We study the strong decays of the S-wave, P-wave, D-wave and radially excited charmed baryons using the $^3P_0$ model. After comparing the calculated decay pattern and total width with the available data, we discuss the possible internal structure and quantum numbers of those charmed baryons observed recently. "
75,CP violation in beauty decays,Michael Gronau,"  Precision tests of the Kobayashi-Maskawa model of CP violation are discussed, pointing out possible signatures for other sources of CP violation and for new flavor-changing operators. The current status of the most accurate tests is summarized. "
76,Universal Forces and the Dark Energy Problem,Afsar Abbas,"  The Dark Energy problem is forcing us to re-examine our models and our understanding of relativity and space-time. Here a novel idea of Fundamental Forces is introduced. This allows us to perceive the General Theory of Relativity and Einstein's Equation from a new pesrpective. In addition to providing us with an improved understanding of space and time, it will be shown how it leads to a resolution of the Dark Energy problem. "
77,Linear perturbations of matched spacetimes: the gauge problem and   background symmetries,"Marc Mars, Filipe C. Mena, Raul Vera",  We present a critical review about the study of linear perturbations of matched spacetimes including gauge problems. We analyse the freedom introduced in the perturbed matching by the presence of background symmetries and revisit the particular case of spherically symmetry in n-dimensions. This analysis includes settings with boundary layers such as brane world models and shell cosmologies. 
78,Operator algebras associated with unitary commutation relations,"Stephen C. Power (Lancaster University), Baruch Solel (Technion)","  We define nonselfadjoint operator algebras with generators $L_{e_1},..., L_{e_n}, L_{f_1},...,L_{f_m}$ subject to the unitary commutation relations of the form \[ L_{e_i}L_{f_j} = \sum_{k,l} u_{i,j,k,l} L_{f_l}L_{e_k}\] where $u= (u_{i,j,k,l})$ is an $nm \times nm$ unitary matrix. These algebras, which generalise the analytic Toeplitz algebras of rank 2 graphs with a single vertex, are classified up to isometric isomorphism in terms of the matrix $u$. "
79,Shaping the Globular Cluster Mass Function by Stellar-Dynamical   Evaporation,Dean E. McLaughlin and S. Michael Fall,"  We show that the globular cluster mass function (GCMF) in the Milky Way depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by -dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal ``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc. Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties (rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values (although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the globular cluster system. "
80,Quantum Deformations of Relativistic Symmetries,"V.N. Tolstoy (INP, Moscow State University)",  We discussed quantum deformations of D=4 Lorentz and Poincare algebras. In the case of Poincare algebra it is shown that almost all classical r-matrices of S. Zakrzewski classification correspond to twisted deformations of Abelian and Jordanian types. A part of twists corresponding to the r-matrices of Zakrzewski classification are given in explicit form. 
81,Matter-Wave Bright Solitons with a Finite Background in Spinor   Bose-Einstein Condensates,"Tetsuo Kurosaki, Miki Wadati","  We investigate dynamical properties of bright solitons with a finite background in the F=1 spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), based on an integrable spinor model which is equivalent to the matrix nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation with a self-focusing nonlineality. We apply the inverse scattering method formulated for nonvanishing boundary conditions. The resulting soliton solutions can be regarded as a generalization of those under vanishing boundary conditions. One-soliton solutions are derived in an explicit manner. According to the behaviors at the infinity, they are classified into two kinds, domain-wall (DW) type and phase-shift (PS) type. The DW-type implies the ferromagnetic state with nonzero total spin and the PS-type implies the polar state, where the total spin amounts to zero. We also discuss two-soliton collisions. In particular, the spin-mixing phenomenon is confirmed in a collision involving the DW-type. The results are consistent with those of the previous studies for bright solitons under vanishing boundary conditions and dark solitons. As a result, we establish the robustness and the usefulness of the multiple matter-wave solitons in the spinor BECs. "
82,Why there is something rather than nothing (out of everything)?,A.O.Barvinsky,"  The path integral over Euclidean geometries for the recently suggested density matrix of the Universe is shown to describe a microcanonical ensemble in quantum cosmology. This ensemble corresponds to a uniform (weight one) distribution in phase space of true physical variables, but in terms of the observable spacetime geometry it is peaked about complex saddle-points of the {\em Lorentzian} path integral. They are represented by the recently obtained cosmological instantons limited to a bounded range of the cosmological constant. Inflationary cosmologies generated by these instantons at late stages of expansion undergo acceleration whose low-energy scale can be attained within the concept of dynamically evolving extra dimensions. Thus, together with the bounded range of the early cosmological constant, this cosmological ensemble suggests the mechanism of constraining the landscape of string vacua and, simultaneously, a possible solution to the dark energy problem in the form of the quasi-equilibrium decay of the microcanonical state of the Universe. "
83,Formation of density singularities in ideal hydrodynamics of freely   cooling inelastic gases: a family of exact solutions,"Itzhak Fouxon, Baruch Meerson, Michael Assaf, Eli Livne","  We employ granular hydrodynamics to investigate a paradigmatic problem of clustering of particles in a freely cooling dilute granular gas. We consider large-scale hydrodynamic motions where the viscosity and heat conduction can be neglected, and one arrives at the equations of ideal gas dynamics with an additional term describing bulk energy losses due to inelastic collisions. We employ Lagrangian coordinates and derive a broad family of exact non-stationary analytical solutions that depend only on one spatial coordinate. These solutions exhibit a new type of singularity, where the gas density blows up in a finite time when starting from smooth initial conditions. The density blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters of particles. As the density blow-up time $t_c$ is approached, the maximum density exhibits a power law $\sim (t_c-t)^{-2}$. The velocity gradient blows up as $\sim - (t_c-t)^{-1}$ while the velocity itself remains continuous and develops a cusp (rather than a shock discontinuity) at the singularity. The gas temperature vanishes at the singularity, and the singularity follows the isobaric scenario: the gas pressure remains finite and approximately uniform in space and constant in time close to the singularity. An additional exact solution shows that the density blowup, of the same type, may coexist with an ""ordinary"" shock, at which the hydrodynamic fields are discontinuous but finite. We confirm stability of the exact solutions with respect to small one-dimensional perturbations by solving the ideal hydrodynamic equations numerically. Furthermore, numerical solutions show that the local features of the density blowup hold universally, independently of details of the initial and boundary conditions. "
84,A Universality in PP-Waves,Partha Mukhopadhyay,"  We discuss a universality property of any covariant field theory in space-time expanded around pp-wave backgrounds. According to this property the space-time lagrangian density evaluated on a restricted set of field configurations, called universal sector, turns out to be same around all the pp-waves, even off-shell, with same transverse space and same profiles for the background scalars. In this paper we restrict our discussion to tensorial fields only. In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell pp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal sector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to the pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results can also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also study such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT). In particular, we argue that for an off-shell pp-wave ansatz with flat transverse space and dilaton independent of transverse coordinates the field redefinition relating the low energy effective field theory and CSFT with all the massive modes integrated out is at most quadratic in fields. Because of this simplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on the two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an iterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT equations of motion has been discussed. All our bosonic string theory analyses can be generalised to the common Neveu-Schwarz sector of superstrings. "
85,Clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas,Vladislav V. Vysotsky,"  We give a quantitative analysis of clustering in a stochastic model of one-dimensional gas. At time zero, the gas consists of $n$ identical particles that are randomly distributed on the real line and have zero initial speeds. Particles begin to move under the forces of mutual attraction. When particles collide, they stick together forming a new particle, called cluster, whose mass and speed are defined by the laws of conservation. We are interested in the asymptotic behavior of $K_n(t)$ as $n\to \infty$, where $K_n(t)$ denotes the number of clusters at time $t$ in the system with $n$ initial particles. Our main result is a functional limit theorem for $K_n(t)$. Its proof is based on the discovered localization property of the aggregation process, which states that the behavior of each particle is essentially defined by the motion of neighbor particles. "
86,Approximate solutions to the Dirichlet problem for harmonic maps between   hyperbolic spaces,Duong Minh Duc and Truong Trung Tuyen,"  Our main result in this paper is the following: Given $H^m, H^n$ hyperbolic spaces of dimensional $m$ and $n$ corresponding, and given a Holder function $f=(s^1,...,f^{n-1}):\partial H^m\to \partial H^n$ between geometric boundaries of $H^m$ and $H^n$. Then for each $\epsilon >0$ there exists a harmonic map $u:H^m\to H^n$ which is continuous up to the boundary (in the sense of Euclidean) and $u|_{\partial H^m}=(f^1,...,f^{n-1},\epsilon)$. "
87,Some new experimental photonic flame effect features,N.V.Tcherniega,"  The results of the spectral, energetical and temporal characteristics of radiation in the presence of the photonic flame effect are presented. Artificial opal posed on Cu plate at the temperature of liquid nitrogen boiling point (77 K) being irradiated by nanosecond ruby laser pulse produces long- term luminiscence with a duration till ten seconds with a finely structured spectrum in the the antistocks part of the spectrum. Analogous visible luminescence manifesting time delay appeared in other samples of the artificial opals posed on the same plate. In the case of the opal infiltrated with different nonlinear liquids the threshold of the luminiscence is reduced and the spatial disribution of the bright emmiting area on the opal surface is being changed. In the case of the putting the frozen nonlinear liquids on the Cu plate long-term blue bright luminiscence took place in the frozen species of the liquids. Temporal characteristics of this luminiscence are nearly the same as in opal matrixes. "
88,A general approach to statistical modeling of physical laws:   nonparametric regression,I. Grabec,"  Statistical modeling of experimental physical laws is based on the probability density function of measured variables. It is expressed by experimental data via a kernel estimator. The kernel is determined objectively by the scattering of data during calibration of experimental setup. A physical law, which relates measured variables, is optimally extracted from experimental data by the conditional average estimator. It is derived directly from the kernel estimator and corresponds to a general nonparametric regression. The proposed method is demonstrated by the modeling of a return map of noisy chaotic data. In this example, the nonparametric regression is used to predict a future value of chaotic time series from the present one. The mean predictor error is used in the definition of predictor quality, while the redundancy is expressed by the mean square distance between data points. Both statistics are used in a new definition of predictor cost function. From the minimum of the predictor cost function, a proper number of data in the model is estimated. "
89,Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS),Lester Ingber,  Real Options for Project Schedules (ROPS) has three recursive sampling/optimization shells. An outer Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) optimization shell optimizes parameters of strategic Plans containing multiple Projects containing ordered Tasks. A middle shell samples probability distributions of durations of Tasks. An inner shell samples probability distributions of costs of Tasks. PATHTREE is used to develop options on schedules.. Algorithms used for Trading in Risk Dimensions (TRD) are applied to develop a relative risk analysis among projects. 
90,Groups with finitely many conjugacy classes and their automorphisms,Ashot Minasyan,"  We combine classical methods of combinatorial group theory with the theory of small cancellations over relatively hyperbolic groups to construct finitely generated torsion-free groups that have only finitely many classes of conjugate elements. Moreover, we present several results concerning embeddings into such groups.   As another application of these techniques, we prove that every countable group $C$ can be realized as a group of outer automorphisms of a group $N$, where $N$ is a finitely generated group having Kazhdan's property (T) and containing exactly two conjugacy classes. "
91,Energy density for chiral lattice fermions with chemical potential,Christof Gattringer and Ludovit Liptak,  We study a recently proposed formulation of overlap fermions at finite density. In particular we compute the energy density as a function of the chemical potential and the temperature. It is shown that overlap fermions with chemical potential reproduce the correct continuum behavior. 
92,Aspects of Electron-Phonon Self-Energy Revealed from Angle-Resolved   Photoemission Spectroscopy,"W.S. Lee, S. Johnston, T.P. Devereaux, and Z.-X. Shen","  Lattice contribution to the electronic self-energy in complex correlated oxides is a fascinating subject that has lately stimulated lively discussions. Expectations of electron-phonon self-energy effects for simpler materials, such as Pd and Al, have resulted in several misconceptions in strongly correlated oxides. Here we analyze a number of arguments claiming that phonons cannot be the origin of certain self-energy effects seen in high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors via angle resolved photoemission experiments (ARPES), including the temperature dependence, doping dependence of the renormalization effects, the inter-band scattering in the bilayer systems, and impurity substitution. We show that in light of experimental evidences and detailed simulations, these arguments are not well founded. "
93,Timing and Lensing of the Colliding Bullet Clusters: barely enough time   and gravity to accelerate the bullet,"HongSheng Zhao (SUPA, St Andrews)","  We present semi-analytical constraint on the amount of dark matter in the merging bullet galaxy cluster using the classical Local Group timing arguments. We consider particle orbits in potential models which fit the lensing data. {\it Marginally consistent} CDM models in Newtonian gravity are found with a total mass M_{CDM} = 1 x 10^{15}Msun of Cold DM: the bullet subhalo can move with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x 10^{15}Msun of CDM for a cluster containing only ~ 10^{14}Msun of gas. Our results are generalisable beyond General Relativity, e.g., a speed of $4500\kms$ is easily obtained in the relativistic MONDian lensing model of Angus et al. (2007). However, MONDian model with little hot dark matter $M_{HDM} \le 0.6\times 10^{15}\msun$ and CDM model with a small halo mass $\le 1\times 10^{15}\msun$ are barely consistent with lensing and velocity data. "
94,Geometry of Locally Compact Groups of Polynomial Growth and Shape of   Large Balls,Emmanuel Breuillard,"  We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series of nilpotent groups. "
95,Much ado about 248,M.C. Nucci and P.G.L. Leach,"  In this note we present three representations of a 248-dimensional Lie algebra, namely the algebra of Lie point symmetries admitted by a system of five trivial ordinary differential equations each of order forty-four, that admitted by a system of seven trivial ordinary differential equations each of order twenty-eight and that admitted by one trivial ordinary differential equation of order two hundred and forty-four. "
96,Conformal Field Theory and Operator Algebras,Yasuyuki Kawahigashi,  We review recent progress in operator algebraic approach to conformal quantum field theory. Our emphasis is on use of representation theory in classification theory. This is based on a series of joint works with R. Longo. 
97,Sparsely-spread CDMA - a statistical mechanics based analysis,"Jack Raymond, David Saad","  Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively small number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of statistical physics. The analysis provides results on the performance of maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system limit. We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code. "
98,On Ando's inequalities for convex and concave functions,Koenraad M.R. Audenaert and Jaspal Singh Aujla,"  For positive semidefinite matrices $A$ and $B$, Ando and Zhan proved the inequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le ||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama, and Kosem, respectively.   In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $||| f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|) |||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.   In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above. "
99,Topology Change of Black Holes,Daisuke Ida and Masaru Siino,"  The topological structure of the event horizon has been investigated in terms of the Morse theory. The elementary process of topological evolution can be understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii) Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat space-times. "
100,The birth of string theory,Paolo Di Vecchia,  In this contribution we go through the developments that in the years 1968 to 1974 led from the Veneziano model to the bosonic string. 
101,Duality and Tameness,"Marc Chardin, Steven Dale Cutkosky, Juergen Herzog and Hema Srinivasan",  We prove a duality theorem for certain graded algebras and show by various examples different kinds of failure of tameness of local cohomology. 
102,Generalized regularly discontinuous solutions of the Einstein equations,Gianluca Gemelli,"  The physical consistency of the match of piecewise-$C^0$ metrics is discussed. The mathematical theory of gravitational discontinuity hypersurfaces is generalized to cover the match of regularly discontinuous metrics. The mean-value differential geometry framework on a hypersurface is introduced, and corresponding compatibility conditions are deduced. Examples of generalized boundary layers, gravitational shock waves and thin shells are studied. "
103,"A geometric realization of sl(6,C)","Giovanni Gaiffi, Michele Grassi","  Given an orientable weakly self-dual manifold X of rank two, we build a geometric realization of the Lie algebra sl(6,C) as a naturally defined algebra L of endomorphisms of the space of differential forms of X. We provide an explicit description of Serre generators in terms of natural generators of L. This construction gives a bundle on X which is related to the search for a natural Gauge theory on X. We consider this paper as a first step in the study of a rich and interesting algebraic structure. "
104,Rigid subsets of symplectic manifolds,Michael Entov and Leonid Polterovich,"  We show that there is an hierarchy of intersection rigidity properties of sets in a closed symplectic manifold: some sets cannot be displaced by symplectomorphisms from more sets than the others. We also find new examples of rigidity of intersections involving, in particular, specific fibers of moment maps of Hamiltonian torus actions, monotone Lagrangian submanifolds (following the works of P.Albers and P.Biran-O.Cornea), as well as certain, possibly singular, sets defined in terms of Poisson-commutative subalgebras of smooth functions. In addition, we get some geometric obstructions to semi-simplicity of the quantum homology of symplectic manifolds. The proofs are based on the Floer-theoretical machinery of partial symplectic quasi-states. "
105,Multiple Parton Scattering in Nuclei: Quark-quark Scattering,"Andreas Schafer, Xin-Nian Wang and Ben-Wei Zhang","  Modifications to quark and antiquark fragmentation functions due to quark-quark (antiquark) double scattering in nuclear medium are studied systematically up to order \cal{O}(\alpha_{s}^2)$ in deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) off nuclear targets. At the order $\cal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark (antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark) distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions. "
106,Experimental modeling of physical laws,I. Grabec,"  A physical law is represented by the probability distribution of a measured variable. The probability density is described by measured data using an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. The experimental information and data redundancy are defined in terms of information entropy. The model cost function, comprised of data redundancy and estimation error, is minimized by the creation-annihilation process. "

108,Half-metallic silicon nanowires,"Engin Durgun, Deniz Cakir, Nurten Akman, and Salim Ciraci","  From first-principles calculations, we predict that transition metal (TM) atom doped silicon nanowires have a half-metallic ground state. They are insulators for one spin-direction, but show metallic properties for the opposite spin direction. At high coverage of TM atoms, ferromagnetic silicon nanowires become metallic for both spin-directions with high magnetic moment and may have also significant spin-polarization at the Fermi level. The spin-dependent electronic properties can be engineered by changing the type of dopant TM atoms, as well as the diameter of the nanowire. Present results are not only of scientific interest, but can also initiate new research on spintronic applications of silicon nanowires. "
109,On Equivariant Embedding of Hilbert C^* modules,Debashish Goswami,"  We prove that an arbitrary (not necessarily countably generated) Hilbert $G$-$\cla$ module on a G-C^* algebra $\cla$ admits an equivariant embedding into a trivial $G-\cla$ module, provided G is a compact Lie group and its action on $\cla$ is ergodic. "
110,Invariance and the twisted Chern character : a case study,Debashish Goswami,"  We give details of the proof of the remark made in \cite{G2} that the Chern characters of the canonical generators on the K homology of the quantum group $SU_q(2)$ are not invariant under the natural $SU_q(2)$ coaction. Furthermore, the conjecture made in \cite{G2} about the nontriviality of the twisted Chern character coming from an odd equivariant spectral triple on $SU_q(2)$ is settled in the affirmative. "
111,Placeholder Substructures III: A Bit-String-Driven ''Recipe Theory'' for   Infinite-Dimensional Zero-Divisor Spaces,Robert P. C. de Marrais,"  Zero-divisors (ZDs) derived by Cayley-Dickson Process (CDP) from N-dimensional hypercomplex numbers (N a power of 2, at least 4) can represent singularities and, as N approaches infinite, fractals -- and thereby,scale-free networks. Any integer greater than 8 and not a power of 2 generates a meta-fractal or ""Sky"" when it is interpreted as the ""strut constant"" (S) of an ensemble of octahedral vertex figures called ""Box-Kites"" (the fundamental building blocks of ZDs). Remarkably simple bit-manipulation rules or ""recipes"" provide tools for transforming one fractal genus into others within the context of Wolfram's Class 4 complexity. "
112,Langmuir blodgett assembly of densely aligned single walled carbon   nanotubes from bulk materials,"Xiaolin Li, Li Zhang, Xinran Wang, Iwao Shimoyama, Xiaoming Sun,   Won-Seok Seo and Hongjie Dai (Department of Chemistry, Stanford University.)","  Single walled carbon nanotubes exhibit advanced electrical and surface properties useful for high performance nanoelectronics. Important to future manufacturing of nanotube circuits is large scale assembly of SWNTs into aligned forms. Despite progress in assembly and oriented synthesis, pristine SWNTs in aligned and close-packed form remain elusive and needed for high current, speed and density devices through collective operations of parallel SWNTs. Here, we develop a Langmuir Blodgett method achieving monolayers of aligned SWNTs with dense packing, central to which is a non covalent polymer functionalization by PmPV imparting high solubility and stability of SWNTs in an organic solvent DCE. Pressure cycling or annealing during LB film compression reduces hysteresis and facilitates high degree alignment and packing of SWNTs characterized by microscopy and polarized Raman spectroscopy. The monolayer SWNTs are readily patterned for device integration by microfabrication, enabling the highest currents 3mA through the narrowest regions packed with aligned SWNTs thus far. "
113,Quantum Phase Transition in the Four-Spin Exchange Antiferromagnet,"Valeri N. Kotov, Dao-Xin Yao, A. H. Castro Neto, D. K. Campbell","  We study the S=1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice with nearest-neighbor and plaquette four-spin exchanges (introduced by A.W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 227202 (2007).)   This model undergoes a quantum phase transition from a spontaneously dimerized phase to N\'eel order at a critical coupling. We show that as the critical point is approached from the dimerized side, the system exhibits strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle density. We find that both singlet and triplet modes of high density condense at the transition, signaling restoration of lattice symmetry. In our approach, which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the transition appears sharp; however since our method breaks down near the critical point, we argue that we cannot make a definite conclusion regarding the order of the transition. "
114,Smooth maps with singularities of bounded K-codimensions,Yoshifumi Ando,  We will prove the relative homotopy principle for smooth maps with singularities of a given {\cal K}-invariant class with a mild condition. We next study a filtration of the group of homotopy self-equivalences of a given manifold P by considering singularities of non-negative {\cal K}-codimensions. 
115,Stringy Jacobi fields in Morse theory,"Yong Seung Cho, Soon-Tae Hong","  We consider the variation of the surface spanned by closed strings in a spacetime manifold. Using the Nambu-Goto string action, we induce the geodesic surface equation, the geodesic surface deviation equation which yields a Jacobi field, and we define the index form of a geodesic surface as in the case of point particles to discuss conjugate strings on the geodesic surface. "
116,Lower ground state due to counter-rotating wave interaction in trapped   ion system,"T. Liu, K.L. Wang, and M. Feng","  We consider a single ion confined in a trap under radiation of two traveling waves of lasers. In the strong-excitation regime and without the restriction of Lamb-Dicke limit, the Hamiltonian of the system is similar to a driving Jaynes-Cummings model without rotating wave approximation (RWA). The approach we developed enables us to present a complete eigensolutions, which makes it available to compare with the solutions under the RWA. We find that, the ground state in our non-RWA solution is energically lower than the counterpart under the RWA. If we have the ion in the ground state, it is equivalent to a spin dependent force on the trapped ion. Discussion is made for the difference between the solutions with and without the RWA, and for the relevant experimental test, as well as for the possible application in quantum information processing.

117,Strained single-crystal Al2O3 grown layer-by-layer on Nb (110) thin   films,Paul B. Welander and James N. Eckstein,"  We report on the layer-by-layer growth of single-crystal Al2O3 thin-films on Nb (110). Single-crystal Nb films are first prepared on A-plane sapphire, followed by the evaporation of Al in an O2 background. The first stages of Al2O3 growth are layer-by-layer with hexagonal symmetry. Electron and x-ray diffraction measurements indicate the Al2O3 initially grows clamped to the Nb lattice with a tensile strain near 10%. This strain relaxes with further deposition, and beyond about 5 nm we observe the onset of island growth. Despite the asymmetric misfit between the Al2O3 film and the Nb under-layer, the observed strain is surprisingly isotropic. "
118,Quasi-quartet crystal electric field ground state in a tetragonal   CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ single crystal,"A. Thamizhavel, R. Kulkarni and S. K. Dhar","  We have successfully grown the single crystals of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$, for the first time, by flux method and studied the anisotropic physical properties by measuring the electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and specific heat. We found that CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}$ = 4.6 K. The electrical resistivity and susceptibility data reveal strong anisotropic magnetic properties. The magnetization measured at $T$ = 2 K exhibited two metamagnetic transitions at $H_{\rm m1}$ = 31 kOe and $H_{\rm m2}$ = 44.7 kOe, for $H \parallel$ [100] with a saturation magnetization of 1.6 $\mu_{\rm B}$/Ce. The crystalline electric field (CEF) analysis of the inverse susceptibility data reveals that the ground state and the first excited states of CeAg$_2$Ge$_2$ are closely spaced indicating a quasi-quartet ground state. The specific heat data lend further support to the presence of closely spaced energy levels. "
119,Strong Phase and $D^0-D^0bar$ mixing at BES-III,"Xiao-Dong Cheng, Kang-Lin He, Hai-Bo Li, Yi-Fang Wang, Mao-Zhi Yang","  Most recently, both BaBar and Belle experiments found evidences of neutral $D$ mixing. In this paper, we discuss the constraints on the strong phase difference in $D^0 \to K\pi$ decay from the measurements of the mixing parameters, $y^\prime$, $y_{CP}$ and $x$ at the $B$ factories. The sensitivity of the measurement of the mixing parameter $y$ is estimated in BES-III experiment at $\psi(3770)$ peak. We also make an estimate on the measurements of the mixing rate $R_M$. Finally, the sensitivity of the strong phase difference at BES-III are obtained by using data near the $D\bar{D}$ threshold with CP tag technique at BES-III experiment. "
120,Meta-Stable Brane Configuration of Product Gauge Groups,Changhyun Ahn,"  Starting from the N=1 SU(N_c) x SU(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors, we apply the Seiberg dual to the first gauge group and obtain the N=1 dual gauge theory with dual matters including the gauge singlets. By analyzing the F-term equations of the superpotential, we describe the intersecting type IIA brane configuration for the meta-stable nonsupersymmetric vacua of this gauge theory. By introducing an orientifold 6-plane, we generalize to the case for N=1 SU(N_c) x SO(N_c') gauge theory with fundamental and bifundamental flavors. Finally, the N=1 SU(N_c) x Sp(N_c') gauge theory with matters is also described very briefly. "
121,Spinor dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates; Classical spin approach,"M. Takahashi, Sankalpa Ghosh, T. Mizushima, K. Machida","  Magnetic dipole-dipole interaction dominated Bose-Einstein condensates are discussed under spinful situations. We treat the spin degrees of freedom as a classical spin vector, approaching from large spin limit to obtain an effective minimal Hamiltonian; a version extended from a non-linear sigma model. By solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation we find several novel spin textures where the mass density and spin density are strongly coupled, depending upon trap geometries due to the long-range and anisotropic natures of the dipole-dipole interaction.

122,Nonlinear Dynamics of the Phonon Stimulated Emission in Microwave   Solid-State Resonator of the Nonautonomous Phaser Generator,D. N. Makovetskii,"  The microwave phonon stimulated emission (SE) has been experimentally and numerically investigated in a nonautonomous microwave acoustic quantum generator, called also microwave phonon laser or phaser (see previous works arXiv:cond-mat/0303188 ; arXiv:cond-mat/0402640 ; arXiv:nlin.CG/0703050) Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

124,Anisotropic thermo-elasticity in 2D -- Part I: A unified approach,Michael Reissig and Jens Wirth,  In this note we develop tools and techniques for the treatment of anisotropic thermo-elasticity in two space dimensions. We use a diagonalisation technique to obtain properties of the characteristic roots of the full symbol of the system in order to prove $L^p$--$L^q$ decay rates for its solutions. 
125,I-V characteristics of the vortex state in MgB2 thin films,"Huan Yang, Ying Jia, Lei Shan, Yingzi Zhang, Hai-Hu Wen, Chenggang   Zhuang, Zikui Liu, Qi Li, Yi Cui, Xiaoxing Xi","  The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of various MgB2 films have been studied at different magnetic fields parallel to c-axis. At fields \mu0H between 0 and 5T, vortex liquid-glass transitions were found in the I-V isotherms. Consistently, the I-V curves measured at different temperatures show a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles. Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

126,Magnetic Fingerprints of sub-100 nm Fe Nanodots,"Randy K. Dumas, Chang-Peng Li, Igor V. Roshchin, Ivan K. Schuller and   Kai Liu","  Sub-100 nm nanomagnets not only are technologically important, but also exhibit complex magnetization reversal behaviors as their dimensions are comparable to typical magnetic domain wall widths. Here we capture magnetic ""fingerprints"" of 1 billion Fe nanodots as they undergo a single domain to vortex state transition, using a first-order reversal curve (FORC) method. As the nanodot size increases from 52 nm to 67 nm, the FORC diagrams reveal striking differences, despite only subtle changes in their major hysteresis loops. The 52 nm nanodots exhibit single domain behavior and the coercivity distribution extracted from the FORC distribution agrees well with a calculation based on the measured nanodot size distribution. The 58 and 67 nm nanodots exhibit vortex states, where the nucleation and annihilation of the vortices are manifested as butterfly-like features in the FORC distribution and confirmed by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, the FORC method gives quantitative measures of the magnetic phase fractions, and vortex nucleation and annihilation fields. "

Swift data are revolutionising our understanding of Gamma Ray Bursts. Since bursts fade rapidly, it is desirable to create and disseminate accurate light curves rapidly.   Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as necessary for a fading source.   Results. The light curve repository website (http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre. "
128,On the total disconnectedness of the quotient Aubry set,Alfonso Sorrentino,"  In this paper we show that the quotient Aubry set associated to certain Lagrangians is totally disconnected (i.e., every connected component consists of a single point). Moreover, we discuss the relation between this problem and a Morse-Sard type property for (difference of) critical subsolutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations. "
129,New simple modular Lie superalgebras as generalized prolongs,"Sofiane Bouarroudj, Pavel Grozman, Dimitry Leites","  Over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>2, prolongations of the simple finite dimensional Lie algebras and Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix are studied for certain simplest gradings of these algebras. Several new simple Lie superalgebras are discovered, serial and exceptional, including superBrown and superMelikyan superalgebras. Simple Lie superalgebras with Cartan matrix of rank 2 are classified. "
130,Vacuum Structure and Potential,J.X. Zheng-Johansson,"  Based on overall experimental observations, especially the pair processes, I developed a model structure of the vacuum along with a basic-particle formation scheme begun in 2000 (with collaborator P-I Johansson). The model consists in that the vacuum is, briefly, filled of neutral but polarizable vacuuons, consisting each of a p-vaculeon and n- vaculeon of charges $+e$ and $-e$ of zero rest masses but with spin motions, assumed interacting each other with a Coulomb force. The model has been introduced in full in a book (Nova Sci, 2005) and referred to in a number of journal/E-print papers. I outline in this easier accessible paper the detailed derivation of the model and a corresponding quantitative determination of the vacuuon size. "
131,Counterflow of electrons in two isolated quantum point contacts,"V.S. Khrapai, S. Ludwig, J.P. Kotthaus, H.P. Tranitz, W. Wegscheider","  We study the interaction between two adjacent but electrically isolated quantum point contacts (QPCs). At high enough source-drain bias on one QPC, the drive QPC, we detect a finite electric current in the second, unbiased, detector QPC. The current generated at the detector QPC always flows in the opposite direction than the current of the drive QPC. The generated current is maximal, if the detector QPC is tuned to a transition region between its quantized conductance plateaus and the drive QPC is almost pinched-off. We interpret this counterflow phenomenon in terms of an asymmetric phonon-induced excitation of electrons in the leads of the detector QPC. "
132,PAH emission and star formation in the host of the z~2.56 Cloverleaf QSO,"D. Lutz, E. Sturm, L.J. Tacconi, E. Valiante, M. Schweitzer, H.   Netzer, R. Maiolino, P. Andreani, O. Shemmer, S. Veilleux","  We report the first detection of the 6.2micron and 7.7micron infrared `PAH' emission features in the spectrum of a high redshift QSO, from the Spitzer-IRS spectrum of the Cloverleaf lensed QSO (H1413+117, z~2.56). The ratio of PAH features and rest frame far-infrared emission is the same as in lower luminosity star forming ultraluminous infrared galaxies and in local PG QSOs, supporting a predominantly starburst nature of the Cloverleaf's huge far-infrared luminosity (5.4E12 Lsun, corrected for lensing). The Cloverleaf's period of dominant QSO activity (Lbol ~ 7E13 Lsun) is coincident with an intense (star formation rate ~1000 Msun/yr) and short (gas exhaustion time ~3E7yr) star forming event. "
133,Causal dissipative hydrodynamics for QGP fluid in 2+1 dimensions,A. K. Chaudhuri,"  In 2nd order causal dissipative theory, space-time evolution of QGP fluid is studied in 2+1 dimensions. Relaxation equations for shear stress tensors are solved simultaneously with the energy-momentum conservation equations. Comparison of evolution of ideal and viscous QGP fluid, initialized under the same conditions, e.g. same equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, indicate that in a viscous dynamics, energy density or temperature of the fluid evolve slowly, than in an ideal fluid. Cooling gets slower as viscosity increases. Transverse expansion also increases in a viscous dynamics. For the first time we have also studied elliptic flow of 'quarks' in causal viscous dynamics. It is shown that elliptic flow of quarks saturates due to non-equilibrium correction to equilibrium distribution function, and can not be mimicked by an ideal hydrodynamics. "
134,A Single Trapped Ion as a Time-Dependent Harmonic Oscillator,Nicolas C. Menicucci and G. J. Milburn,"  We show how a single trapped ion may be used to test a variety of important physical models realized as time-dependent harmonic oscillators. The ion itself functions as its own motional detector through laser-induced electronic transitions. Alsing et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220401 (2005)] proposed that an exponentially decaying trap frequency could be used to simulate (thermal) Gibbons-Hawking radiation in an expanding universe, but the Hamiltonian used was incorrect. We apply our general solution to this experimental proposal, correcting the result for a single ion and showing that while the actual spectrum is different from the Gibbons-Hawking case, it nevertheless shares an important experimental signature with this result. "
135,Compounding Fields and Their Quantum Equations in the Trigintaduonion   Space,Zihua Weng,"  The 32-dimensional compounding fields and their quantum interplays in the trigintaduonion space can be presented by analogy with octonion and sedenion electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the electromagnetic, gravitational, strong and weak interactions, the study deduces some conclusions of field source particles (quarks and leptons) and intermediate particles which are consistent with current some sorts of interaction theories. In the trigintaduonion fields which are associated with the hyper-strong and strong-weak fields, the paper draws some predicts and conclusions of the field source particles (sub-quarks) and intermediate particles. The research results show that there may exist some new particles in the nature. "
136,"Topological defects, geometric phases, and the angular momentum of light",S C Tiwari,  Recent reports on the intriguing features of vector vortex bearing beams are analyzed using geometric phases in optics. It is argued that the spin redirection phase induced circular birefringence is the origin of topological phase singularities arising in the inhomogeneous polarization patterns. A unified picture of recent results is presented based on this proposition. Angular momentum shift within the light beam (OAM) has exact equivalence with the angular momentum holonomy associated with the geometric phase consistent with our conjecture. 
137,Circular and non-circular nearly horizon-skimming orbits in Kerr   spacetimes,"Enrico Barausse, Scott A. Hughes, Luciano Rezzolla","  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed. This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric) family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA. "
138,The Blue Straggler Population of the Globular Cluster M5,"B. Lanzoni (1,2), E. Dalessandro (1,2), F.R. Ferraro (1), C. Mancini   (3), G. Beccari (2,4,5), R.T. Rood (6), M. Mapelli (7), S. Sigurdsson (8) (1   Dip. Astro., Bologna; 2 INAF--Oss. Astro., Bologna, 3 Dip. Astro. e Scienza   dello Spazio, Firenze; 4 Dip. di Scienze della Comunicazione, Teramo; 5   INAF--Oss. Astro. di Collurania, Teramo; 6 Dep. of Astronomy and   Astrophysics, The Pennsylvania State University; 7 S.I.S.S.A., Via Beirut 2 -   4, Trieste; 8 Astronomy Department, University of Virginia)","  By combining high-resolution HST and wide-field ground based observations, in ultraviolet and optical bands, we study the Blue Stragglers Star (BSS) population of the galactic globular cluster M5 (NGC 5904) from its very central regions up to its periphery. The BSS distribution is highly peaked in the cluster center, decreases at intermediate radii and rises again outward. Such a bimodal distribution is similar to those previously observed in other globular clusters (M3, 47Tucanae, NGC6752). As for these clusters, dynamical simulations suggest that, while the majority of BSS in M5 could be originated by stellar collisions, a significant fraction (20-40%) of BSS generated by mass transfer processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal radius. If confirmed, this could represent an interesting case of an ""evaporating"" BSS. "
139,Entanglement entropy of two-dimensional Anti-de Sitter black holes,Mariano Cadoni,"  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence we derive a formula for the entanglement entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole in two spacetime dimensions. The leading term in the large black hole mass expansion of our formula reproduces exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass. "
140,Towards self-consistent definition of instanton liquid parameters,"S.V. Molodtsov, G.M. Zinovjev",  The possibility of self-consistent determination of instanton liquid parameters is discussed together with the definition of optimal pseudo-particle configurations and comparing the various pseudo-particle ensembles. The weakening of repulsive interactions between pseudo-particles is argued and estimated. 
141,Some aspects of the nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model,J. Kaupuzs,"  A nonperturbative renormalization of the phi^4 model is considered. First we integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q. Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation of the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k < Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation is consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration results for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the phi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare the expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic perturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which sense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact. "
142,Instanton Liquid at Finite Temperature and Chemical Potential of Quarks,"S.V. Molodtsov, G.M. Zinovjev","  Instanton liquid in heated and strongly interacting matter is studied using the variational principle. The dependence of the instanton liquid density (gluon condensate) on the temperature and the quark chemical potential is determined under the assumption that, at finite temperatures, the dominant contribution is given by an ensemble of calorons. The respective one-loop effective quark Lagrangian is used. "
143,Eternal inflation and localization on the landscape,"D. Podolsky, K. Enqvist","  We model the essential features of eternal inflation on the landscape of a dense discretuum of vacua by the potential $V(\phi)=V_{0}+\delta V(\phi)$, where $|\delta V(\phi)|\ll V_{0}$ is random. We find that the diffusion of the distribution function $\rho(\phi,t)$ of the inflaton expectation value in different Hubble patches may be suppressed due to the effect analogous to the Anderson localization in disordered quantum systems. At $t \to \infty$ only the localized part of the distribution function $\rho (\phi, t)$ survives which leads to dynamical selection principle on the landscape. The probability to measure any but a small value of the cosmological constant in a given Hubble patch on the landscape is exponentially suppressed at $t\to \infty$. "
144,Singularity Resolution in Isotropic Loop Quantum Cosmology: Recent   Developments,Ghanashyam Date,"  Since the past Iagrg meeting in December 2004, new developments in loop quantum cosmology have taken place, especially with regards to the resolution of the Big Bang singularity in the isotropic models. The singularity resolution issue has been discussed in terms of physical quantities (expectation values of Dirac observables) and there is also an ``improved'' quantization of the Hamiltonian constraint. These developments are briefly discussed.   This is an expanded version of the review talk given at the 24$^{\mathrm{th}}$ IAGRG meeting in February 2007. "
145,Vortices in Bose-Einstein Condensates: Theory,"N. G. Parker, B. Jackson, A. M. Martin, and C. S. Adams","  Vortices are pervasive in nature, representing the breakdown of laminar fluid flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids. In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear optics, and type-II superconductors. "
146,A POVM view of the ensemble approach to polarization optics,"Sudha, A. V. Gopala Rao, A. R. Usha Devi and A. K. Rajagopal","  Statistical ensemble formalism of Kim, Mandel and Wolf (J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 4, 433 (1987)) offers a realistic model for characterizing the effect of stochastic non-image forming optical media on the state of polarization of transmittedlight. With suitable choice of the Jones ensemble, various Mueller transformations - some of which have been unknown so far - are deduced. It is observed that the ensemble approach is formally identical to the positive operator valued measures (POVM) on the quantum density matrix. This observation, in combination with the recent suggestion by Ahnert and Payne (Phys. Rev. A 71, 012330, (2005)) - in the context of generalized quantum measurement on single photon polarization states - that linear optics elements can be employed in setting up all possible POVMs, enables us to propose a way of realizing different types of Mueller devices. "
147,Reexamination of spin decoherence in semiconductor quantum dots from   equation-of-motion approach,"J. H. Jiang, Y. Y. Wang, and M. W. Wu","  The longitudinal and transversal spin decoherence times, $T_1$ and $T_2$, in semiconductor quantum dots are investigated from equation-of-motion approach for different magnetic fields, quantum dot sizes, and temperatures. Various mechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature, though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature. "
148,Construction of initial data for 3+1 numerical relativity,"Eric Gourgoulhon (LUTH, CNRS / Observatoire de Paris / Univ. Paris 7)","  This lecture is devoted to the problem of computing initial data for the Cauchy problem of 3+1 general relativity. The main task is to solve the constraint equations. The conformal technique, introduced by Lichnerowicz and enhanced by York, is presented. Two standard methods, the conformal transverse-traceless one and the conformal thin sandwich, are discussed and illustrated by some simple examples. Finally a short review regarding initial data for binary systems (black holes and neutron stars) is given. "
149,Magnetism and Thermodynamics of Spin-1/2 Heisenberg Diamond Chains in a   Magnetic Field,Bo Gu and Gang Su,"  The magnetic and thermodynamic properties of spin-1/2 Heisenberg diamond chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0 (frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0 (non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and $4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition, the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with our TMRG results. "
150,Extraction of physical laws from joint experimental data,I. Grabec,"  The extraction of a physical law y=yo(x) from joint experimental data about x and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x) the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy. With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly related variables. "
151,Kinetic equation for finite systems of fermions with pairing,"V.I. Abrosimov, D.M. Brink, A.Dellafiore, F. Matera","  The solutions of the Wigner-transformed time-dependent Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov equations are studied in the constant-$\Delta$ approximation. This approximation is known to violate particle-number conservation. As a consequence, the density fluctuation and the longitudinal response function given by this approximation contain spurious contributions. A simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number conservation is proposed. Explicit expressions for the eigenfrequencies of the correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The collective response is studied for a simplified form of the residual interaction. "
152,Reciprocal Symmetry and Classical Discrete Oscillator Incorporating   Half-Integral Energy Levels,Mushfiq Ahmad,"  Classical oscillator differential equation is replaced by the corresponding (finite time) difference equation. The equation is, then, symmetrized so that it remains invariant under the change d going to -d, where d is the smallest span of time. This symmetric equation has solutions, which come in reciprocally related pairs. One member of a pair agrees with the classical solution and the other is an oscillating solution and does not converge to a limit as d goes to 0. This solution contributes to oscillator energy a term which is a multiple of half-integers. "
153,Hadrons in Medium -- Theory confronts experiment,"Fabian Eichstaedt, Stefan Leupold, Ulrich Mosel, Pascal Muehlich","  In this talk we briefly summarize our theoretical understanding of in-medium selfenergies of hadrons. With the special case of the $\omega$ meson we demonstrate that earlier calculations that predicted a significant lowering of the mass in medium are based on an incorrect treatment of the model Lagrangian; more consistent calculations lead to a significant broadening, but hardly any mass shift. We stress that the experimental reconstruction of hadron spectral functions from measured decay products always requires knowledge of the decay branching ratios which may also be strongly mass-dependent. It also requires a quantitatively reliable treatment of final state interactions which has to be part of any reliable theory. "
154,A computer program for fast non-LTE analysis of interstellar line   spectra,"Floris van der Tak (SRON Groningen), John Black (Onsala), Fredrik   Schoeier (Stockholm), David Jansen and Ewine van Dishoeck (Leiden)","  The large quantity and high quality of modern radio and infrared line observations require efficient modeling techniques to infer physical and chemical parameters such as temperature, density, and molecular abundances. We present a computer program to calculate the intensities of atomic and molecular lines produced in a uniform medium, based on statistical equilibrium calculations involving collisional and radiative processes and including radiation from background sources. Optical depth effects are treated with an escape probability method. The program is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/index.shtml . The program makes use of molecular data files maintained in the Leiden Atomic and Molecular Database (LAMDA), which will continue to be improved and expanded. The performance of the program is compared with more approximate and with more sophisticated methods. An Appendix provides diagnostic plots to estimate physical parameters from line intensity ratios of commonly observed molecules. This program should form an important tool in analyzing observations from current and future radio and infrared telescopes. "

156,Alternative Approaches to the Equilibrium Properties of Hard-Sphere   Liquids,"M. Lopez de Haro, S. B. Yuste, and A. Santos","  An overview of some analytical approaches to the computation of the structural and thermodynamic properties of single component and multicomponent hard-sphere fluids is provided. For the structural properties, they yield a thermodynamically consistent formulation, thus improving and extending the known analytical results of the Percus-Yevick theory. Approximate expressions for the contact values of the radial distribution functions and the corresponding analytical equations of state are also discussed. Extensions of this methodology to related systems, such as sticky hard spheres and square-well fluids, as well as its use in connection with the perturbation theory of fluids are briefly addressed. "
157,Complexities of Human Promoter Sequences,"Fangcui Zhao, Huijie Yang, and Binghong Wang","  By means of the diffusion entropy approach, we detect the scale-invariance characteristics embedded in the 4737 human promoter sequences. The exponent for the scale-invariance is in a wide range of $[ {0.3,0.9} ]$, which centered at $\delta_c = 0.66$. The distribution of the exponent can be separated into left and right branches with respect to the maximum. The left and right branches are asymmetric and can be fitted exactly with Gaussian form with different widths, respectively. "
158,Evidence for an excitonic insulator phase in 1T-TiSe$_{2}$,"H. Cercellier, C. Monney, F. Clerc, C. Battaglia, L. Despont, M. G.   Garnier, H. Beck, L. Patthey, H. Berger, P. Aebi","  We present a new high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission study of 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$ in both, its room-temperature, normal phase and its low-temperature, charge-density wave phase. At low temperature the photoemission spectra are strongly modified, with large band renormalisations at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone and a very large transfer of spectral weight to backfolded bands. A theoretical calculation of the spectral function for an excitonic insulator phase reproduces the experimental features with very good agreement. This gives strong evidence in favour of the excitonic insulator scenario as a driving force for the charge-density wave transition in 1\textit{T}-TiSe$_{2}$. "
159,Oxygen-rich droplets and the enrichment of the ISM,"G. Stasinska, G. Tenorio-Tagle, M. Rodriguez, W. J. Henney","  We argue that the discrepancies observed in HII regions between abundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs) might well be the signature of a scenario of the enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) proposed by Tenorio-Tagle (1996). In this scenario, the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed ORL-CEL discrepancy.

160,Soft modes and NTE in Zn(CN)2 from Raman spectroscopy and first   principles calculations,"T. R. Ravindran, A. K. Arora, Sharat Chandra, M. C. Valsakumar and N.   V. Chandra Shekar","  We have studied Zn(CN)2 at high pressure using Raman spectroscopy, and report Gruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigen vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the observed phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit, with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid disordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction. "
161,Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics,I. Grabec,"  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data. "
162,Effective potentials for quasicrystals from ab-initio data,"Peter Brommer and Franz G\""ahler (Institut f\""ur Theoretische und   Angewandte Physik, Universit\""at Stuttgart)","  Classical effective potentials are indispensable for any large-scale atomistic simulations, and the relevance of simulation results crucially depends on the quality of the potentials used. For complex alloys like quasicrystals, however, realistic effective potentials are practically inexistent. We report here on our efforts to develop effective potentials especially for quasicrystalline alloy systems. We use the so-called force matching method, in which the potential parameters are adapted so as to optimally reproduce the forces and energies in a set of suitably chosen reference configurations. These reference data are calculated with ab-initio methods. As a first application, EAM potentials for decagonal Al-Ni-Co, icosahedral Ca-Cd, and both icosahedral and decagonal Mg-Zn quasicrystals have been constructed. The influence of the potential range and degree of specialisation on the accuracy and other properties is discussed and compared. "
163,On smooth foliations with Morse singularities,Lilia Rosati,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$ foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere. In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems, proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type result. "
164,Frobenius-Schur indicators for semisimple Lie algebras,Mohammad Abu-Hamed and Shlomo Gelaki,"  Let g be a finite dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra, and let V be a finite dimensional represenation of g. We give a closed formula for the mth Frobenius-Schur indicator, m>1, of V in representation-theoretic terms. We deduce that the indicators take integer values, and that for a large enough m, the mth indicator of V equals the dimension of the zero weight space of V. For the classical Lie algebras sl(n), so(2n), so(2n+1) and sp(2n), this is the case for m greater or equal to 2n-1, 4n-5, 4n-3 and 2n+1, respectively. "
165,Supersymmetry breaking metastable vacua in runaway quiver gauge theories,"Inaki Garcia-Etxebarria, Fouad Saad, Angel M. Uranga","  In this paper we consider quiver gauge theories with fractional branes whose infrared dynamics removes the classical supersymmetric vacua (DSB branes). We show that addition of flavors to these theories (via additional non-compact branes) leads to local meta-stable supersymmetry breaking minima, closely related to those of SQCD with massive flavors. We simplify the study of the one-loop lifting of the accidental classical flat directions by direct computation of the pseudomoduli masses via Feynman diagrams. This new approach allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the results for the $dP_1$ theory in hep-th/0607218. The new approach allows to generalize the computation to general examples of DSB branes, and for arbitrary values of the superpotential couplings. "
166,Low Energy Aspects of Heavy Meson Decays,Jan O. Eeg,"  I discuss low energy aspects of heavy meson decays, where there is at least one heavy meson in the final state. Examples are $B -\bar{B}$ mixing, $B \to D \bar{D}$, $B \to D \eta'$, and $B \to D \gamma$. %and $B \to D W $ (Isgur-Wise function). The analysis is performed in the heavy quark limit within heavy-light chiral perturbation theory. Coefficients of $1/N_c$ suppressed chiral Lagrangian terms (beyond factorization) have been estimated by means of a heavy-light chiral quark model. "
167,Radiative losses and cut-offs of energetic particles at relativistic   shocks,Paul Dempsey and Peter Duffy,"  We investigate the acceleration and simultaneous radiative losses of electrons in the vicinity of relativistic shocks. Particles undergo pitch angle diffusion, gaining energy as they cross the shock by the Fermi mechanism and also emitting synchrotron radiation in the ambient magnetic field. A semi-analytic approach is developed which allows us to consider the behaviour of the shape of the spectral cut-off and the variation of that cut-off with the particle pitch angle. The implications for the synchrotron emission of relativistic jets, such as those in gamma ray burst sources and blazars, are discussed. "
168,Very strong and slowly varying magnetic fields as source of axions,Giorgio Calucci,"  The investigation on the production of particles in slowly varying but extremely intense magnetic field in extended to the case of axions. The motivation is, as for some previously considered cases, the possibility that such kind of magnetic field may exist around very compact astrophysical objects. "
169,Symmetry disquisition on the TiOX phase diagram,"Daniele Fausti, Tom T. A. Lummen, Cosmina Angelescu, Roberto Macovez,   Javier Luzon, Ria Broer, Petra Rudolf, Paul H.M. van Loosdrecht, Natalia   Tristan, Bernd Buchner, Sander van Smaalen, Angela Moller, Gerd Meyer, Timo   Taetz","  The sequence of phase transitions and the symmetry of in particular the low temperature incommensurate and spin-Peierls phases of the quasi one-dimensional inorganic spin-Peierls system TiOX (TiOBr and TiOCl) have been studied using inelastic light scattering experiments. The anomalous first-order character of the transition to the spin-Peierls phase is found to be a consequence of the different symmetries of the incommensurate and spin-Peierls (P$2_{1}/m$) phases.   The pressure dependence of the lowest transition temperature strongly suggests that magnetic interchain interactions play an important role in the formation of the spin-Peierls and the incommensurate phases. Finally, a comparison of Raman data on VOCl to the TiOX spectra shows that the high energy scattering observed previously has a phononic origin. "
170,Discovery of a point-like very-high-energy gamma-ray source in Monoceros,"F. Aharonian, et al","  The complex Monoceros Loop SNR/Rosette Nebula region contains several potential sources of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission and two as yet unidentified high-energy EGRET sources. Sensitive VHE observations are required to probe acceleration processes in this region. The H.E.S.S. telescope array has been used to search for very high-energy gamma-ray sources in this region. CO data from the NANTEN telescope were used to map the molecular clouds in the region, which could act as target material for gamma-ray production via hadronic interactions. We announce the discovery of a new gamma-ray source, HESS J0632+058, located close to the rim of the Monoceros SNR. This source is unresolved by H.E.S.S. and has no clear counterpart at other wavelengths but is possibly associated with the weak X-ray source 1RXS J063258.3+054857, the Be-star MWC 148 and/or the lower energy gamma-ray source 3EG J0634+0521. No evidence for an associated molecular cloud was found in the CO data. "
171,Thermal entanglement of qubit pairs on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice,"S. El Shawish, A. Ramsak, and J. Bonca","  We show that temperature and magnetic field properties of the entanglement between spins on the two-dimensional Shastry-Sutherland lattice can be qualitatively described by analytical results for a qubit tetramer. Exact diagonalization of clusters with up to 20 sites reveals that the regime of fully entangled neighboring pairs coincides with the regime of finite spin gap in the spectrum. Additionally, the results for the regime of vanishing spin gap are discussed and related to the Heisenberg limit of the model. "
172,Bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO,H. Takenaka and D.J. Singh,  We investigate the bonding of H in O vacancies of ZnO using density functional calculations. We find that H is anionic and does not form multicenter bonds with Zn in this compound. 
173,"Reparametrization Invariance, the controversial extraction of $\alpha$   from $B\to\pi\pi$ and New Physics","Francisco J. Botella (Valencia U. & Valencia U., IFIC), Miguel Nebot   (Lisbon, IST)","  The extraction of the weak phase $\alpha$ from $B\to\pi\pi$ decays has been controversial from a statistical point of view, as the frequentist vs. bayesian confrontation shows. We analyse several relevant questions which have not deserved full attention and pervade the extraction of $\alpha$. Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$ through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around $\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece. "
174,Solar System Constraints on Gauss-Bonnet Mediated Dark Energy,"Luca Amendola, Christos Charmousis and Stephen C. Davis","  Although the Gauss-Bonnet term is a topological invariant for general relativity, it couples naturally to a quintessence scalar field, modifying gravity at solar system scales. We determine the solar system constraints due to this term by evaluating the post-Newtonian metric for a distributional source. We find a mass dependent, 1/r^7 correction to the Newtonian potential, and also deviations from the Einstein gravity prediction for light-bending. We constrain the parameters of the theory using planetary orbits, the Cassini spacecraft data, and a laboratory test of Newton's law, always finding extremely tight bounds on the energy associated to the Gauss-Bonnet term. We discuss the relevance of these constraints to late-time cosmological acceleration. "
175,Switching mechanism of photochromic diarylethene derivatives molecular   junctions,"Jing Huang, Qunxiang Li, Hao Ren, Haibin Su, Q. W. Shi, and Jinlong   Yang","  The electronic transport properties and switching mechanism of single photochromic diarylethene derivatives sandwiched between two gold surfaces with closed and open configurations are investigated by a fully self-consistent nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory. The calculated transmission spectra of two configurations are strikingly distinctive. The open form lacks any significant transmission peak within a wide energy window, while the closed structure has two significant transmission peaks on the both sides of the Fermi level. The electronic transport properties of the molecular junction with closed structure under a small bias voltage are mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the experimental measured results. Moreover, we find that the switching behavior within a wide bias voltage window is extremely robust to both substituting F or S for H or O and varying end anchoring atoms from S to Se and Te. "

Bayer (1) ((1) Universit\""at Dortmund, Germany,   (2) Washington, USA, (3) Ruhr-Universit\""at Bochum, Germany)","  Using the recently reported mode locking effect we demonstrate a highly robust control of electron spin coherence in an ensemble of (In,Ga)As quantum dots during the single spin coherence time. The spin precession in a transverse magnetic field can be fully controlled up to 25 K by the parameters of the exciting pulsed laser protocol such as the pulse train sequence, leading to adjustable quantum beat bursts in Faraday rotation. Flipping of the electron spin precession phase was demonstrated by inverting the polarization within a pulse doublet sequence. "
177,Equation of state for dense hydrogen and plasma phase transition,"Bastian Holst, Nadine Nettelmann, Ronald Redmer","  We calculate the equation of state of dense hydrogen within the chemical picture. Fluid variational theory is generalized for a multi-component system of molecules, atoms, electrons, and protons. Chemical equilibrium is supposed for the reactions dissociation and ionization. We identify the region of thermodynamic instability which is related to the plasma phase transition. The reflectivity is calculated along the Hugoniot curve and compared with experimental results. The equation-of-state data is used to calculate the pressure and temperature profiles for the interior of Jupiter. "
178,Experimental nonclassicality of single-photon-added thermal light states,"Alessandro Zavatta, Valentina Parigi, and Marco Bellini","  We report the experimental realization and tomographic analysis of novel quantum light states obtained by exciting a classical thermal field by a single photon. Such states, although completely incoherent, possess a tunable degree of quantumness which is here exploited to put to a stringent experimental test some of the criteria proposed for the proof and the measurement of state non-classicality. The quantum character of the states is also given in quantum information terms by evaluating the amount of entanglement that they can produce. "
179,Neutron Skin and Giant Resonances in Nuclei,Vadim Rodin,"  Some aspects, both experimental and theoretical, of extracting the neutron skin $\Delta R$ from properties of isovector giant resonances are discussed. Existing proposals are critically reviewed. The method relying on the energy difference between the GTR and IAS is shown to lack sensitivity to $\Delta R$. A simple explanation of the linear relation between the symmetry energy and the neutron skin is also given. "
180,Genetic Optimization of Photonic Bandgap Structures,"Joel Goh, Ilya Fushman, Dirk Englund, and Jelena Vuckovic","  We investigate the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to design a set of photonic crystals (PCs) in one and two dimensions. Our flexible design methodology allows us to optimize PC structures which are optimized for specific objectives. In this paper, we report the results of several such GA-based PC optimizations. We show that the GA performs well even in very complex design spaces, and therefore has great potential for use as a robust design tool in present and future applications. "
181,Huge magneto-crystalline anisotropy of x-ray linear dichroism observed   on Co/FeMn bilayers,"W. Kuch, F. Offi, L. I. Chelaru, J. Wang, K. Fukumoto, M. Kotsugi, J.   Kirschner, J. Kunes","  We present an x-ray spectromicroscopic investigation of single-crystalline magnetic FeMn/Co bilayers on Cu(001), using X-ray magnetic circular (XMCD) and linear (XMLD) dichroism at the Co and Fe L3 absorption edges in combination with photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM). Using the magnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic Co layer and the antiferromagnetic FeMn layer we are able to produce magnetic domains with two different crystallographic orientations of the magnetic easy axis within the same sample at the same time. We find a huge difference in the XMLD contrast between the two types of magnetic domains, which we discuss in terms of intrinsic magneto-crystalline anisotropy of XMLD of the Co layer. We also demonstrate that due to the high sensitivity of the method, the small number of induced ferromagnetic Fe moments at the FeMn-Co interface is sufficient to obtain magnetic contrast from XMLD in a metallic system.

182,Temperature Dependence of the Tensile Properties of Single Walled Carbon   Nanotubes: O(N) Tight Binding MD Simulation,"G. Dereli and B. Sungu (Yildiz Tech. Univ., Istanbul)","  This paper examines the effect of temperature on the structural stability and mechanical properties of 20 layered (10,10) single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) under tensile loading using an O(N) tight binding molecular dynamics (TBMD) simulation method. We observed that (10,10) tube can sustain its structural stability for the strain values of 0.23 in elongation and 0.06 in compression at 300K. Bond breaking strain value decreases with increasing temperature under streching but not under compression. The elastic limit, Young's modulus, tensile strength and Poisson ratio are calculated as 0.10, 0.395 TPa, 83.23 GPa, 0.285, respectively, at 300K. In the temperature range from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of 300K to 900K. "
183,Gamma-ray emitting AGN and GLAST,P. Padovani (ESO),"  I describe the different classes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the basic tenets of unified schemes. I then review the properties of the extragalactic sources detected in the GeV and TeV bands, showing that the vast majority of them belong to the very rare blazar class. I further discuss the kind of AGN GLAST is likely to detect, making some predictions going from the obvious to the likely, all the way to the less probable. "
184,Potfit: effective potentials from ab-initio data,"Peter Brommer and Franz G\""ahler (Institut f\""ur Theoretische und   Angewandte Physik, Universit\""at Stuttgart)","  We present a program called potfit which generates an effective atomic interaction potential by matching it to a set of reference data computed in first-principles calculations. It thus allows to perform large-scale atomistic simulations of materials with physically justified potentials. We describe the fundamental principles behind the program, emphasizing its flexibility in adapting to different systems and potential models, while also discussing its limitations. The program has been used successfully in creating effective potentials for a number of complex intermetallic alloys, notably quasicrystals. "
185,Dark energy and neutrino model in SUSY -- Remarks on active and sterile   neutrinos mixing --,Ryo Takahashi and Morimitsu Tanimoto,"  We consider a Mass Varying Neutrinos (MaVaNs) model in supersymmetric theory. The model includes effects of supersymmetry breaking transmitted by the gravitational interaction from the hidden sector, in which supersymmetry was broken, to the dark energy sector. Then evolutions of the neutrino mass and the equation of state parameter of the dark energy are presented in the model. It is remarked that only the mass of a sterile neutrino is variable in the case of the vanishing mixing between the left-handed and a sterile neutrino on cosmological time scale. The finite mixing makes the mass of the left-handed neutrino variable. "
186,The transverse proximity effect in spectral hardness on the line of   sight towards HE 2347-4342,"G. Worseck (1), C. Fechner (2,3), L. Wisotzki (1) and A. Dall'Aglio   (1) ((1) Astrophysikalisches Institut Potsdam, (2) Hamburger Sternwarte, (3)   Universit\""at Potsdam)","  We report the discovery of 14 quasars in the vicinity of HE2347-4342, one of the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342: QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302, $\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$ arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338. Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest. Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr. "
187,Biased random walks on combs,Tanya M Elliott and John F Wheater,"  We develop rigorous, analytic techniques to study the behaviour of biased random walks on combs. This enables us to calculate exactly the spectral dimension of random comb ensembles for any bias scenario in the teeth or spine. Two specific examples of random comb ensembles are discussed; the random comb with nonzero probability of an infinitely long tooth at each vertex on the spine and the random comb with a power law distribution of tooth lengths. We also analyze transport properties along the spine for these probability measures. "
188,Monoid generalizations of the Richard Thompson groups,J. C. Birget,"  The groups G_{k,1} of Richard Thompson and Graham Higman can be generalized in a natural way to monoids, that we call M_{k,1}, and to inverse monoids, called Inv_{k,1}; this is done by simply generalizing bijections to partial functions or partial injective functions. The monoids M_{k,1} have connections with circuit complexity (studied in another paper). Here we prove that M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are congruence-simple for all k. Their Green relations J and D are characterized: M_{k,1} and Inv_{k,1} are J-0-simple, and they have k-1 non-zero D-classes. They are submonoids of the multiplicative part of the Cuntz algebra O_k. They are finitely generated, and their word problem over any finite generating set is in P. Their word problem is coNP-complete over certain infinite generating sets.   Changes in this version: Section 4 has been thoroughly revised, and errors have been corrected; however, the main results of Section 4 do not change. Sections 1, 2, and 3 are unchanged, except for the proof of Theorem 2.3, which was incomplete; a complete proof was published in the Appendix of reference [6], and is also given here. "

In the present paper, we examine the validity of [the SK assumption on the direction] of the incident neutrinos. Concretely speaking, we analyze muon-like events due to QEL. For the purpose, we develop [Time Sequential Monte Carlo Simulation] to extract the conclusion on the validity of the SK assumption. In our [Time Sequential Simulation], we simulate every physical process concerned as exactly as possible without any approximation.   From the comparison between the zenith angle distributon of the emitted muons under [the SK assumption on the direction] and the corresponding one obtained under our [Time Sequential Simulation], it is concluded that the measurement of the direction of the incident neutrino for the neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the SK analysis turns out to be unreliable, which holds irrespective of the existence and/or non-existence of the neutrino oscillation.

190,Intricate Knots in Proteins: Function and Evolution,"Peter Virnau (1), Leonid A. Mirny (1,2), Mehran Kardar (1) ((1)   Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Physics, Cambridge, MA,   United States of America, (2) Massachusetts Institute of Technology,   Harvard-MIT Division of Health Science and Technology, Cambridge, MA, United   States of America)","  A number of recently discovered protein structures incorporate a rather unexpected structural feature: a knot in the polypeptide backbone. These knots are extremely rare, but their occurrence is likely connected to protein function in as yet unexplored fashion. Our analysis of the complete Protein Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a knotted structure in this protein. "
191,Star Formation in Galaxies with Large Lower Surface Brightness Disks,"K. O'Neil, S. Oey, G. Bothun","  We present B, R, and Halpha imaging data of 19 large disk galaxies whose properties are intermediate between classical low surface brightness galaxies and ordinary high surface brightness galaxies. We use data taken from the Lowell 1.8m Perkins telescope to determine the galaxies' overall morphology, color, and star formation properties. Morphologically, the galaxies range from Sb through Irr and include galaxies with and without nuclear bars. The colors of the galaxies vary from B-R = 0.3 - 1.9, and most show at least a slight bluing of the colors with increasing radius. The Halpha images of these galaxies show an average star formation rate lower than is found for similar samples with higher surface brightness disks. Additionally, the galaxies studied have both higher gas mass-to-luminosity and diffuse Halpha emission than is found in higher surface brightness samples. "
192,Domain Wall Dynamics near a Quantum Critical Point,"Shengjun Yuan, Hans De Raedt, Seiji Miyashita","  We study the real-time domain-wall dynamics near a quantum critical point of the one-dimensional anisotropic ferromagnetic spin 1/2 chain. By numerical simulation, we find the domain wall is dynamically stable in the Heisenberg-Ising model. Near the quantum critical point, the width of the domain wall diverges as $(\Delta -1) ^{-1/2}$.

193,Quantum mechanical approach to decoherence and relaxation generated by   fluctuating environment,S.A. Gurvitz and D. Mozyrsky,"  We consider an electrostatic qubit, interacting with a fluctuating charge of single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model. The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling. Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit, as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency, depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model. "
194,Group-theoretical properties of nilpotent modular categories,"Vladimir Drinfeld, Shlomo Gelaki, Dmitri Nikshych, Victor Ostrik","  We characterize a natural class of modular categories of prime power Frobenius-Perron dimension as representation categories of twisted doubles of finite p-groups. We also show that a nilpotent braided fusion category C admits an analogue of the Sylow decomposition. If the simple objects of C have integral Frobenius-Perron dimensions then C is group-theoretical. As a consequence, we obtain that semisimple quasi-Hopf algebras of prime power dimension are group-theoretical. Our arguments are based on a reconstruction of twisted group doubles from Lagrangian subcategories of modular categories (this is reminiscent to the characterization of doubles of quasi-Lie bialgebras in terms of Manin pairs).

195,Remarks on N_c dependence of decays of exotic baryons,"Karolina Piesciuk, Michal Praszalowicz",  We calculate the N_c dependence of the decay widths of exotic eikosiheptaplet within the framework of Chral Quark Soliton Model. We also discuss generalizations of regular baryon representations for arbitrary N_c. 
196,Analysis of random Boolean networks using the average sensitivity,Steffen Schober and Martin Bossert,"  In this work we consider random Boolean networks that provide a general model for genetic regulatory networks. We extend the analysis of James Lynch who was able to proof Kauffman's conjecture that in the ordered phase of random networks, the number of ineffective and freezing gates is large, where as in the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

197,Theory of polariton mediated Raman scattering in microcavities,"L. M. Leon Hilario, A. Bruchhausen, A. M. Lobos, A. A. Aligia","  We calculate the intensity of the polariton mediated inelastic light scattering in semiconductor microcavities. We treat the exciton-photon coupling nonperturbatively and incorporate lifetime effects in both excitons and photons, and a coupling of the photons to the electron-hole continuum. Taking the matrix elements as fitting parameters, the results are in excellent agreement with measured Raman intensities due to optical phonons resonant with the upper polariton branches in II-VI microcavities with embedded CdTe quantum wells.

198,Decomposition numbers for finite Coxeter groups and generalised   non-crossing partitions,"Christian Krattenthaler (Universit\""at Wien) and Thomas M\""uller   (Queen Mary & Westfield College, University of London)","  Given a finite irreducible Coxeter group $W$, a positive integer $d$, and types $T_1,T_2,...,T_d$ (in the sense of the classification of finite Coxeter groups), we compute the number of decompositions $c=\si_1\si_2 cdots\si_d$ of a Coxeter element $c$ of $W$, such that $\si_i$ is a Coxeter element in a subgroup of type $T_i$ in $W$, $i=1,2,...,d$, and such that the factorisation is ""minimal"" in the sense that the sum of the ranks of the $T_i$'s, $i=1,2,...,d$, equals the rank of $W$. For the exceptional types, these decomposition numbers have been computed by the first author. The type $A_n$ decomposition numbers have been computed by Goulden and Jackson, albeit using a somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$ decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new. These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and fixed integers $r_1\le r_2\le ...\le r_l$, the number of multi-chains $\pi_1\le \pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions poset, where the poset rank of $\pi_i$ equals $r_i$, and where the ""block structure"" of $\pi_1$ is prescribed. We demonstrate that this result implies all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras. Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which, in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

199,Electromagnetic polarizabilities and the excited states of the nucleon,Martin Schumacher,"  The electromagnetic polarizabilities of the nucleon are shown to be essentially composed of the nonresonant $\alpha_p(E_{0+})=+3.2$, $\alpha_n(E_{0+})=+4.1$,the $t$-channel $\alpha^t_{p,n}=-\beta^t_{p,n}=+7.6$ and the resonant $\beta_{p,n}(P_{33}(1232))=+8.3$ contributions (in units of $10^{-4}$fm$^3$. The remaining deviations from the experimental data $\Delta\alpha_p=1.2\pm 0.6$, $\Delta\beta_p=1.2\mp 0.6$, \Delta\alpha_n=0.8\pm 1.7$ and $\Delta\beta_n=2.0\mp 1.8$ are contributed by a larger number of resonant and nonresonant processes with cancellations between the contributions. This result confirms that dominant contributions to the electric and magnetic polarizabilities may be represented in terms of two-photon couplings to the $\sigma$-meson having the predicted mass $m_\sigma=666$ MeV and two-photon width $\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}=2.6$ keV.

200,Hecke-Clifford algebras and spin Hecke algebras I: the classical affine   type,"Ta Khongsap, Weiqiang Wang","  Associated to the classical Weyl groups, we introduce the notion of degenerate spin affine Hecke algebras and affine Hecke-Clifford algebras. For these algebras, we establish the PBW properties, formulate the intertwiners, and describe the centers. We further develop connections of these algebras with the usual degenerate (i.e. graded) affine Hecke algebras of Lusztig by introducing a notion of degenerate covering affine Hecke algebras. "
201,Towards Minimal Resources of Measurement-based Quantum Computation,Simon Perdrix,  We improve the upper bound on the minimal resources required for measurement-based quantum computation. Minimizing the resources required for this model is a key issue for experimental realization of a quantum computer based on projective measurements. This new upper bound allows also to reply in the negative to the open question about the existence of a trade-off between observable and ancillary qubits in measurement-based quantum computation. 
202,A Spitzer census of the IC 348 nebula,"August A. Muench, Charles J. Lada, K. L. Luhman, James Muzerolle and   Erick Young","  We present a Spitzer based census of the IC 348 nebula and embedded star cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42 class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold, starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

203,Non-Equilibrium Josephson and Andreev Current through Interacting   Quantum Dots,"Marco G. Pala, Michele Governale, J\""urgen K\""onig","  We present a theory of transport through interacting quantum dots coupled to normal and superconducting leads in the limit of weak tunnel coupling. A Josephson current between two superconducting leads, carried by first-order tunnel processes, can be established by non-equilibrium proximity effect. Both Andreev and Josephson current is suppressed for bias voltages below a threshold set by the Coulomb charging energy. A $\pi$-transition of the supercurrent can be driven by tuning gate or bias voltages. "
204,Discovery of X-ray emission from the young radio pulsar PSR J1357-6429,"P. Esposito, A. Tiengo, A. De Luca, F. Mattana","  We present the first X-ray detection of the very young pulsar PSR J1357-6429 (characteristic age of 7.3 kyr) using data from the XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites. We find that the spectrum is well described by a power-law plus blackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160 eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed. The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and allow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a compact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the X-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar. "
205,Resonant activation in bistable semiconductor lasers,"Stefano Lepri, Giovanni Giacomelli","  We theoretically investigate the possibility of observing resonant activation in the hopping dynamics of two-mode semiconductor lasers. We present a series of simulations of a rate-equations model under random and periodic modulation of the bias current. In both cases, for an optimal choice of the modulation time-scale, the hopping times between the stable lasing modes attain a minimum. The simulation data are understood by means of an effective one-dimensional Langevin equation with multiplicative fluctuations. Our conclusions apply to both Edge Emitting and Vertical Cavity Lasers, thus opening the way to several experimental tests in such optical systems. "
206,Quark matter and the astrophysics of neutron stars,M Prakash,  Some of the means through which the possible presence of nearly deconfined quarks in neutron stars can be detected by astrophysical observations of neutron stars from their birth to old age are highlighted. 
207,Some non-braided fusion categories of rank 3,Tobias J. Hagge and Seung-Moon Hong,"  We classify all fusion categories for a given set of fusion rules with three simple object types. If a conjecture of Ostrik is true, our classification completes the classification of fusion categories with three simple object types. To facilitate the discussion we describe a convenient, concrete and useful variation of graphical calculus for fusion categories, discuss pivotality and sphericity in this framework, and give a short and elementary re-proof of the fact that the quadruple dual functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity.

Zhekov   (Space Res Inst)","  We have been monitoring Supernova (SN) 1987A with {\it Chandra X-Ray Observatory} since 1999. We present a review of previous results from our {\it Chandra} observations, and some preliminary results from new {\it Chandra} data obtained in 2006 and 2007. High resolution imaging and spectroscopic studies of SN 1987A with {\it Chandra} reveal that X-ray emission of SN 1987A originates from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January), X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component plane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$ than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$). "
209,Classification of superpotentials,"Andrew Dancer, Mckenzie Wang","  We extend our previous classification of superpotentials of ``scalar curvature type"" for the cohomogeneity one Ricci-flat equations. We now consider the case not covered in our previous paper, i.e., when some weight vector of the superpotential lies outside (a scaled translate of) the convex hull of the weight vectors associated with the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit. In this situation we show that either the isotropy representation has at most 3 irreducible summands or the first order subsystem associated to the superpotential is of the same form as the Calabi-Yau condition for submersion type metrics on complex line bundles over a Fano K\""ahler-Einstein product. "
210,Linkedness and ordered cycles in digraphs,"Daniela K\""uhn and Deryk Osthus","  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum outdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large digraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on the minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of Manoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which ensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every ordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which encounters these vertices in this order.

211,Curvature and isocurvature perturbations in two-field inflation,"Z. Lalak, D. Langlois, S. Pokorski, K. Turzynski","  We study cosmological perturbations in two-field inflation, allowing for non-standard kinetic terms. We calculate analytically the spectra of curvature and isocurvature modes at Hubble crossing, up to first order in the slow-roll parameters. We also compute numerically the evolution of the curvature and isocurvature modes from well within the Hubble radius until the end of inflation. We show explicitly for a few examples, including the recently proposed model of `roulette' inflation, how isocurvature perturbations affect significantly the curvature perturbation between Hubble crossing and the end of inflation.

213,A schematic model of scattering in PT-symmetric Quantum Mechanics,Miloslav Znojil,"  One-dimensional scattering problem admitting a complex, PT-symmetric short-range potential V(x) is considered. Using a Runge-Kutta-discretized version of Schroedinger equation we derive the formulae for the reflection and transmission coefficients and emphasize that the only innovation emerges in fact via a complexification of one of the potential-characterizing parameters.

214,The exact asymptotic of the collision time tail distribution for   independent Brownian particles with different drifts,Zbigniew Pucha{\l}a and Tomasz Rolski,"  In this note we consider the time of the collision $\tau$ for $n$ independent Brownian motions $X^1_t,...,X_t^n$ with drifts $a_1,...,a_n$, each starting from $x=(x_1,...,x_n)$, where $x_1<...<x_n$. We show the exact asymptotics of $P_x(\tau>t) = C h(x)t^{-\alpha}e^{-\gamma t}(1 + o(1))$ as $t\to\infty$ and identify $C,h(x),\alpha,\gamma$ in terms of the drifts. "
215,Ab initio Study of Graphene on SiC,Alexander Mattausch and Oleg Pankratov,"  Employing density-functional calculations we study single and double graphene layers on Si- and C-terminated 1x1-6H-SiC surfaces. We show that, in contrast to earlier assumptions, the first carbon layer is covalently bonded to the substrate, and cannot be responsible for the graphene-type electronic spectrum observed experimentally. The characteristic spectrum of free-standing graphene appears with the second carbon layer, which exhibits a weak van der Waals bonding to the underlying structure. For Si-terminated substrate, the interface is metallic, whereas on C-face it is semiconducting or semimetallic for single or double graphene coverage, respectively. "
216,Capacity of a Multiple-Antenna Fading Channel with a Quantized Precoding   Matrix,Wiroonsak Santipach and Michael L. Honig,"  Given a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel, feedback from the receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver, which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal, i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers (matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched filter can require significantly more feedback.

217,On Almost Periodicity Criteria for Morphic Sequences in Some Particular   Cases,Yuri Pritykin,"  In some particular cases we give criteria for morphic sequences to be almost periodic (=uniformly recurrent). Namely, we deal with fixed points of non-erasing morphisms and with automatic sequences. In both cases a polynomial-time algorithm solving the problem is found. A result more or less supporting the conjecture of decidability of the general problem is given. "
218,"The Radio Emission, X-ray Emission, and Hydrodynamics of G328.4+0.2: A   Comprehensive Analysis of a Luminous Pulsar Wind Nebula, its Neutron Star,   and the Progenitor Supernova Explosion","Joseph D. Gelfand, B. M. Gaensler, Patrick O. Slane, Daniel J.   Patnaude, John P. Hughes, Fernando Camilo","  We present new observational results obtained for the Galactic non-thermal radio source G328.4+0.2 to determine both if this source is a pulsar wind nebula or supernova remnant, and in either case, the physical properties of this source. Using X-ray data obtained by XMM, we confirm that the X-ray emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7 arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these observational results, we test if G328.4+0.2 is a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) or a large PWN inside a supernova remnant (SNR) using a simple hydrodynamic model for the evolution of a PWN inside a SNR. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that G328.4+0.2 is a young (< 10000 years old) pulsar wind nebula formed by a low magnetic field (<10^12 G) neutron star born spinning rapidly (<10 ms) expanding into an undetected SNR formed by an energetic (>10^51 ergs), low ejecta mass (M < 5 Solar Masses) supernova explosion which occurred in a low density (n~0.03 cm^{-3}) environment.

219,Three Particle Correlations from STAR,Jason Glyndwr Ulery (for the STAR Collaboration),"  Two-particle correlations have shown modification to the away-side shape in central Au+Au collisions relative to $pp$, d+Au and peripheral Au+Au collisions. Different scenarios can explain this modification including: large angle gluon radiation, jets deflected by transverse flow, path length dependent energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission, conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a high $p_T$ trigger particle with two softer particles. Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications of the results for the presence or absence of conical flow from Mach-cones are discussed. "
220,The Return of a Static Universe and the End of Cosmology,"Lawrence M. Krauss (1,2) and Robert J. Scherrer (2) ((1) Case Western   Reserve University, (2) Vanderbilt University)","  We demonstrate that as we extrapolate the current $\Lambda$CDM universe forward in time, all evidence of the Hubble expansion will disappear, so that observers in our ""island universe"" will be fundamentally incapable of determining the true nature of the universe, including the existence of the highly dominant vacuum energy, the existence of the CMB, and the primordial origin of light elements. With these pillars of the modern Big Bang gone, this epoch will mark the end of cosmology and the return of a static universe. In this sense, the coordinate system appropriate for future observers will perhaps fittingly resemble the static coordinate system in which the de Sitter universe was first presented. "
221,Dark Matter annihilation in Draco: new considerations on the expected   gamma flux,Miguel A. Sanchez-Conde,"  A new estimation of the gamma-ray flux that we expect to detect from SUSY dark matter annihilation from the Draco dSph is presented using the DM density profiles compatible with the latest observations. This calculation takes also into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the telescope. We show that this effect is crucial in the way we will observe and interpret a possible signal detection. Finally, we discuss the prospects to detect a possible gamma signal from Draco for MAGIC and GLAST. "
222,Magnetohydrodynamic Rebound Shocks of Supernovae,"Yu-Qing Lou (1,2,3) and Wei-Gang Wang (1), ((1) Tsinghua Center For   astrophysics, Tsinghua University, (2)The University of Chicago, (3) National   Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Science.)","  We construct magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) similarity rebound shocks joining `quasi-static' asymptotic solutions around the central degenerate core to explore an MHD model for the evolution of random magnetic field in supernova explosions. This provides a theoretical basis for further studying synchrotron diagnostics, MHD shock acceleration of cosmic rays, and the nature of intense magnetic field in compact objects. The magnetic field strength in space approaches a limiting ratio, that is comparable to the ratio of the ejecta mass driven out versus the progenitor mass, during this self-similar rebound MHD shock evolution. The intense magnetic field of the remnant compact star as compared to that of the progenitor star is mainly attributed to both the gravitational core collapse and the radial distribution of magnetic field.

223,Are There Mach Cones in Heavy Ion Collisions? Three-Particle   Correlations from STAR,Jason Glyndwr Ulery (for the STAR Collaboration),"  We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal correlations for a $3<p_T<4$ GeV/c trigger particle with two softer $1<p_T<2$ GeV/c particles. Results are shown for pp, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200 GeV$. We observe a 3-particle correlation in central Au+Au collisions which may indicate the presence of conical emission. In addition, the dependence of the observed signal angular position on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can be used to distinguish conical flow from simple QCD-\v{C}erenkov radiation. An important aspect of the analysis is the subtraction of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction and the flow harmonics $v_2$ and $v_4$ are investigated in detail. "
224,Exploring First Stars Era with GLAST,A. Kashlinsky and D. Band,"  Cosmic infrared background (CIB) includes emissions from objects inaccessible to current telescopic studies, such as the putative Population III, the first stars. Recently, strong direct evidence for significant CIB levels produced by the first stars came from CIB fluctuations discovered in deep Spitzer images. Such CIB levels should have left a unique absorption feature in the spectra of high-z GRBs and blazars as suggested in [4]. This is observable with GLAST sources at z>2 and measuring this absorption will give important information on energetics and constituents of the first stars era. "

We explore this possibility analizing XMM-Newton observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783. A detiled time-resolved spectral analysis is performed down to the shortest possible time-scales (few ks) using ""excess maps"" and cross-correlating light curves in different energy bands. In addition to a constant core of the Fe K alpha line, we detected a variable and redshifted Fe K alpha emission feature between 5.3-6.1 keV. The line exhibits a modulation on a time-scale of 27 ks that is similar to and in phase with a modulation of the 0.3-10 keV source continuum. The time-scale of the correlated variability of the redshifted Fe line and continuum agrees with the local dynamical time-scale of the accretion disc at 10 r_g around a black hole of 10^7 M_sun. Given the shape of the redshfted line emission and the overall X-ray variability pattern, the line is likely to arise from the relativistic region near the black hole. "
226,Isotopic Effects in Nuclear Reactions at Relativistic Energies,"C.Sfienti, M. De Napoli, S. Bianchin, A.S. Botvina, J. Brzychczyk, A.   Le Fevre, J. Lukasik, P. Pawlowski, W. Trautmann and the ALADiN2000   Collaboration","  A systematic study of isotopic effects in the break-up of projectile spectators at relativistic energies has been performed at the GSI laboratory with the ALADiN spectrometer coupled to the LAND neutron detector. Besides a primary beam of 124Sn, also secondary beams of 124La and 107Sn produced at the FRS fragment separator have been used in order to extend the range of isotopic compositions. The gross properties of projectile fragmentation are very similar for all the studied systems but specific isotopic effects have been observed in both neutron and charged particle production. The breakup temperatures obtained from the double ratios of isotopic yields have been extracted and compared with the limiting-temperature expectation. "
227,"Einstein vs Maxwell: Is gravitation a curvature of space, a field in   flat space, or both?",Theo M. Nieuwenhuizen,"  Starting with a field theoretic approach in Minkowski space, the gravitational energy momentum tensor is derived from the Einstein equations in a straightforward manner. This allows to present them as {\it acceleration tensor} = const. $\times$ {\it total energy momentum tensor}. For flat space cosmology the gravitational energy is negative and cancels the material energy. In the relativistic theory of gravitation a bimetric coupling between the Riemann and Minkowski metrics breaks general coordinate invariance. The case of a positive cosmological constant is considered. A singularity free version of the Schwarzschild black hole is solved analytically. In the interior the components of the metric tensor quickly die out, but do not change sign, leaving the role of time as usual. For cosmology the $\Lambda$CDM model is covered, while there appears a form of inflation at early times. Here both the total energy and the zero point energy vanish. "
228,Geometric Complexity Theory VI: the flip via saturated and positive   integer programming in representation theory and algebraic geometry,Ketan D. Mulmuley,"  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems): specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here, in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs. NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

229,Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?,R. Duffard and F. Roig,"  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of 0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that, together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16 may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main Belt. "

231,New algebraic aspects of perturbative and non-perturbative Quantum Field   Theory,"Christoph Bergbauer, Dirk Kreimer","  In this expository article we review recent advances in our understanding of the combinatorial and algebraic structure of perturbation theory in terms of Feynman graphs, and Dyson-Schwinger equations. Starting from Lie and Hopf algebras of Feynman graphs, perturbative renormalization is rephrased algebraically. The Hochschild cohomology of these Hopf algebras leads the way to Slavnov-Taylor identities and Dyson-Schwinger equations. We discuss recent progress in solving simple Dyson-Schwinger equations in the high energy sector using the algebraic machinery. Finally there is a short account on a relation to algebraic geometry and number theory: understanding Feynman integrals as periods of mixed (Tate) motives. "
232,Many-body interband tunneling as a witness for complex dynamics in the   Bose-Hubbard model,"Andrea Tomadin, Riccardo Mannella, and Sandro Wimberger","  A perturbative model is studied for the tunneling of many-particle states from the ground band to the first excited energy band, mimicking Landau-Zener decay for ultracold, spinless atoms in quasi-one dimensional optical lattices subjected to a tunable tilting force. The distributions of the computed tunneling rates provide an independent and experimentally accessible signature of the regular-chaotic transition in the strongly correlated many-body dynamics of the ground band.

234,The Determination of the Helicity of $W'$ Boson Couplings at the LHC,Thomas G. Rizzo,"  Apart from its mass and width, the most important property of a new charged gauge boson, $W'$, is the helicity of its couplings to the SM fermions. Such particles are expected to exist in many extensions of the Standard Model. In this paper we explore the capability of the LHC to determine the $W'$ coupling helicity at low integrated luminosities in the $\ell +E_T^{miss}$ discovery channel. We find that measurements of the transverse mass distribution, reconstructed from this final state in the $W-W'$ interference region, provides the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.

237,Radio Astrometric Detection and Characterization of Extra-Solar Planets:   A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force,"Geoffrey C. Bower (Berkeley), Alberto Bolatto (Berkeley), Eric Ford   (CfA, Florida), Paul Kalas (Berkeley), Jim Ulvestad (NRAO)","  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass planets possible.   RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method, coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.   The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap for exoplanet discovery and characterization. "
238,Interface dynamics of microscopic cavities in water,Joachim Dzubiella,"  An analytical description of the interface motion of a collapsing nanometer-sized spherical cavity in water is presented by a modification of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation in conjunction with explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative agreement is found between the two approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent conditions while in the continuum picture the solvent viscosity has to be corrected for curvature effects. The typical magnitude of the interface or collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in nonequilibrium. "
239,"Viscosity, Black Holes, and Quantum Field Theory","D. T. Son, A. O. Starinets","  We review recent progress in applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to finite-temperature field theory. In particular, we show how the hydrodynamic behavior of field theory is reflected in the low-momentum limit of correlation functions computed through a real-time AdS/CFT prescription, which we formulate. We also show how the hydrodynamic modes in field theory correspond to the low-lying quasinormal modes of the AdS black p-brane metric. We provide a proof of the universality of the viscosity/entropy ratio within a class of theories with gravity duals and formulate a viscosity bound conjecture. Possible implications for real systems are mentioned. "
240,Superconducting states of the quasi-2D Holstein model: Effects of vertex   and non-local corrections,J.P.Hague,"  I investigate superconducting states in a quasi-2D Holstein model using the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA). The effects of spatial fluctuations (non-local corrections) are examined and approximations neglecting and incorporating lowest-order vertex corrections are computed. The approximation is expected to be valid for electron-phonon couplings of less than the bandwidth. The phase diagram and superconducting order parameter are calculated. Effects which can only be attributed to theories beyond Migdal--Eliashberg theory are present. In particular, the order parameter shows momentum dependence on the Fermi-surface with a modulated form and s-wave order is suppressed at half-filling. The results are discussed in relation to Hohenberg's theorem and the BCS approximation. "

242,Renormalized quasiparticles in antiferromagnetic states of the Hubbard   model,J. Bauer and A.C. Hewson,"  We analyze the properties of the quasiparticle excitations of metallic antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf k$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle picture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total electron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state. "

Dewhurst (4) and E. K. U. Gross (2)","  The relative merits of current-spin-density- and spin-density-functional theory are investigated for solids treated within the exact-exchange-only approximation. Spin-orbit splittings and orbital magnetic moments are determined at zero external magnetic field. We find that for magnetic (Fe, Co and Ni) and non-magnetic (Si and Ge) solids, the exact-exchange current-spin-density functional approach does not significantly improve the accuracy of the corresponding spin-density functional results.

244,One-loop MHV Rules and Pure Yang-Mills,"Andreas Brandhuber, Bill Spence, Gabriele Travaglini, Konstantinos   Zoubos","  It has been known for some time that the standard MHV diagram formulation of perturbative Yang-Mills theory is incomplete, as it misses rational terms in one-loop scattering amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills. We propose that certain Lorentz violating counterterms, when expressed in the field variables which give rise to standard MHV vertices, produce precisely these missing terms. These counterterms appear when Yang-Mills is treated with a regulator, introduced by Thorn and collaborators, which arises in worldsheet formulations of Yang-Mills theory in the lightcone gauge. As an illustration of our proposal, we show that a simple one-loop, two-point counterterm is the generating function for the infinite sequence of one-loop, all-plus helicity amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills, in complete agreement with known expressions.

245,Fermi-liquid effects in the transresistivity in quantum Hall double   layers near $\nu= 1/2 $,Natalya A. Zimbovskaya,"  Here, we present theoretical studies of the temperature and magnetic field dependences of the Coulomb drag transresistivity between two parallel layers of two dimensional electron gases in quantum Hall regime near half filling of the lowest Landau level. It is shown that Fermi-liquid interactions between the relevant quasiparticles could give a significant effect on the transresistivity, providing its independence of the interlayer spacing for spacings taking on values reported in the experiments. Obtained results agree with the experimental evidence. "

Subject to a reasonable assumption in the 1/2-supersymmetric time-like case of the gauged theory, we derive the complete form of all supersymmetric solutions. This includes a number of new 1/4- and 1/2-supersymmetric possibilities, like gravitational waves on bubbles of nothing in AdS_4. "
247,A Rigorous Time-Domain Analysis of Full--Wave Electromagnetic Cloaking   (Invisibility),Ricardo Weder,"  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves. The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1} is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones, $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory. This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium $\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals. "
248,Non-perturbative conserving approximations and Luttinger's sum rule,"Jutta Ortloff, Matthias Balzer, Michael Potthoff",  Weak-coupling conserving approximations can be constructed by truncations of the Luttinger-Ward functional and are well known as thermodynamically consistent approaches which respect macroscopic conservation laws as well as certain sum rules at zero temperature. These properties can also be shown for variational approximations that are generated within the framework of the self-energy-functional theory without a truncation of the diagram series. Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under which the sum rule holds within a non-perturbative conserving approximation. Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site approximation. The validity of the sum rule for finite Hubbard clusters and the consequences for cluster extensions of the dynamical mean-field theory are discussed. 
249,2D-MIT as self-doping of a Wigner-Mott insulator,S. Pankov and V. Dobrosavljevic,"  We consider an interaction-driven scenario for the two-dimensional metal-insulator transition in zero magnetic field (2D-MIT), based on melting the Wigner crystal through vacancy-interstitial pair formation. We show that the transition from the Wigner-Mott insulator to a heavy Fermi liquid emerges as an instability to self-doping, resembling conceptually the solid to normal liquid transition in He3. The resulting physical picture naturally explains many puzzling features of the 2D-MIT. "
250,Entanglement of Subspaces and Error Correcting Codes,"Gilad Gour, Nolan R. Wallach","  We introduce the notion of entanglement of subspaces as a measure that quantify the entanglement of bipartite states in a randomly selected subspace. We discuss its properties and in particular we show that for maximally entangled subspaces it is additive. Furthermore, we show that maximally entangled subspaces can play an important role in the study of quantum error correction codes. We discuss both degenerate and non-degenerate codes and show that the subspace spanned by the logical codewords of a non-degenerate code is a 2k-totally (maximally) entangled subspace. As for non-degenerate codes, we provide a mathematical definition in terms of subspaces and, as an example, we analyze Shor's nine qubits code in terms of 22 mutually orthogonal subspaces. "
251,Does the present data on B_s - bar B_s mixing rule out a large   enhancement in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- ?,Ashutosh Kumar Alok and S. Uma Sankar,"  In this letter, we consider the constraints imposed by the recent measurement of B_s - bar B_s mixing on the new physics contribution to the rare decay B_s --> mu+ mu-. New physics in the form vector and axial-vector couplings is already severely constrained by the data on B --> (K,K*) mu+ mu-. Here, we show that B_s - bar B_s mixing data, together with the data on K0 - bar K0 mixing and K_L --> mu+ mu- decay rate, strongly constrain the scalar-pseudoscalar contribution to B_s --> mu+ mu-. We conclude that new physics can at best lead to a factor of 2 increase in the branching ratio of B_s --> mu+ mu- compared to its Standard Model expectation. "

Koerner","  We present maps of 1.5 square degrees of the Serpens dark cloud at 24, 70, and 160\micron observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope MIPS Camera. More than 2400 compact sources have been extracted at 24um, nearly 100 at 70um, and 4 at 160um. We estimate completeness limits for our 24um survey from Monte Carlo tests with artificial sources inserted into the Spitzer maps. We compare source counts, colors, and magnitudes in the Serpens cloud to two reference data sets, a 0.50 deg^2 set on a low-extinction region near the dark cloud, and a 5.3 deg^2 subset of the SWIRE ELAIS N1 data that was processed through our pipeline. These results show that there is an easily identifiable population of young stellar object candidates in the Serpens Cloud that is not present in either of the reference data sets. We also show a comparison of visual extinction and cool dust emission illustrating a close correlation between the two, and find that the most embedded YSO candidates are located in the areas of highest visual extinction.

253,Unravelling the sbottom spin at the CERN LHC,Alexandre Alves and Oscar Eboli,"  Establishing that a signal of new physics is undoubtly supersymmetric requires not only the discovery of the supersymmetric partners but also probing their spins and couplings. We show that the sbottom spin can be probed at the CERN Large Hadron Collider using only angular correlations in sbottom pair production with subsequent decay of sbottoms into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino, which allow us to distinguish a universal extra dimensional interpretation with a fermionic heavy bottom quark from supersymmetry with a bosonic bottom squark. We demonstrate that this channel provides a clear indication of the sbottom spin provided the sbottom production rate and branching ratio into bottom quark plus the lightest neutralino are sufficiently large to have a clear signal above Standard Model backgrounds.

254,Modeling the three-point correlation function,"Felipe Marin (Chicago, KICP), Risa Wechsler (KIPAC, Stanford), Joshua   Frieman (Chicago, KICP and Fermilab), Robert Nichol (ICG, Portsmouth)","  We present new predictions for the galaxy three-point correlation function (3PCF) using high-resolution dissipationless cosmological simulations of a flat LCDM Universe which resolve galaxy-size halos and subhalos. We create realistic mock galaxy catalogs by assigning luminosities and colors to dark matter halos and subhalos, and we measure the reduced 3PCF as a function of luminosity and color in both real and redshift space. As galaxy luminosity and color are varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated 3PCF. The agreement between the model predictions and galaxy 3PCF measurements lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM halos and subhalos. "
255,Multi-spectral Observations of Lunar Occultations: I. Resolving The Dust   Shell Around AFGL 5440,Paul M. Harvey and Andrew Oldag,"  We present observations and modeling of a lunar occultation of the dust-enshrouded carbon star AFGL 5440. The observations were made over a continuous range of wavelengths from 1 - 4um with a high-speed spectrophotometer designed expressly for this purpose. We find that the occultation fringes cannot be fit by any single-size model. We use the DUSTY radiative transfer code to model a circumstellar shell and fit both the observed occultation light curves and the spectral energy distribution described in the literature. We find a strong constraint on the inner radius of the dust shell, Tmax = 950 K +/- 50K, and optical depth at 5um of 0.5 +/- 0.1. The observations are best fit by models with a density gradient of r^-2 or the gradient derived by Ivezic & Elitzur for a radiatively driven hydrodynamic outflow. Our models cannot fit the observed IRAS 60um flux without assuming a substantial abundance of graphite or by assuming a substantially higher mass-loss rate in the past. "
256,Orbifold cohomology of abelian symplectic reductions and the case of   weighted projective spaces,Tara S. Holm,"  These notes accompany a lecture about the topology of symplectic (and other) quotients. The aim is two-fold: first to advertise the ease of computation in the symplectic category; and second to give an account of some new computations for weighted projective spaces. We start with a brief exposition of how orbifolds arise in the symplectic category, and discuss the techniques used to understand their topology. We then show how these results can be used to compute the Chen-Ruan orbifold cohomology ring of abelian symplectic reductions. We conclude by comparing the several rings associated to a weighted projective space. We make these computations directly, avoiding any mention of a stacky fan or of a labeled moment polytope. "
257,Correlation functions in the Non Perturbative Renormalization Group and   field expansion,"Diego Guerra, Ramon Mendez-Galain and Nicolas Wschebor","  The usual procedure of including a finite number of vertices in Non Perturbative Renormalization Group equations in order to obtain $n$-point correlation functions at finite momenta is analyzed. This is done by exploiting a general method recently introduced which includes simultaneously all vertices although approximating their momentum dependence. The study is performed using the self-energy of the tridimensional scalar model at criticality. At least in this example, low order truncations miss quantities as the critical exponent $\eta$ by as much as 60%. However, if one goes to high order truncations the procedure seems to converge rapidly. "
258,Formation and Collisional Evolution of Kuiper Belt Objects,"Scott J. Kenyon, Benjamin C. Bromley, David P. O'Brien, Donald R.   Davis","  This chapter summarizes analytic theory and numerical calculations for the formation and collisional evolution of KBOs at 20--150 AU. We describe the main predictions of a baseline self-stirring model and show how dynamical perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations. Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified' calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and evolution. "

The necessary and sufficient conditions are presented for the boundary value to belong to certain subspaces of the space of hyperfunctions. 
260,Constraints on the Self-Interaction Cross-Section of Dark Matter from   Numerical Simulations of the Merging Galaxy Cluster 1E 0657-5,"Scott W. Randall, Maxim Markevitch, Douglas Clowe, Anthony H.   Gonzalez, and Marusa Bradac","  (Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

261,Stringy Instantons at Orbifold Singularities,"Riccardo Argurio, Matteo Bertolini, Gabriele Ferretti, Alberto Lerda   and Christoffer Petersson","  We study the effects produced by D-brane instantons on the holomorphic quantities of a D-brane gauge theory at an orbifold singularity. These effects are not limited to reproducing the well known contributions of the gauge theory instantons but also generate extra terms in the superpotential or the prepotential. On these brane instantons there are some neutral fermionic zero-modes in addition to the ones expected from broken supertranslations. They are crucial in correctly reproducing effects which are dual to gauge theory instantons, but they may make some other interesting contributions vanish. We analyze how orientifold projections can remove these zero-modes and thus allow for new superpotential terms. These terms contribute to the dynamics of the effective gauge theory, for instance in the stabilization of runaway directions. "
262,Turbulent Diffusion of Lines and Circulations,Gregory L. Eyink,"  We study material lines and passive vectors in a model of turbulent flow at infinite-Reynolds number, the Kraichnan-Kazantsev ensemble of velocities that are white-noise in time and rough (Hoelder continuous) in space. It is argued that the phenomenon of ``spontaneous stochasticity'' generalizes to material lines and that conservation of circulations generalizes to a ``martingale property'' of the stochastic process of lines.

By means of systematic observations of the BL Lac prototype PKS 2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS 2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source. On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points. "
265,Supernova Polarization and the Type IIn Classification,Jennifer L. Hoffman,"  While the members of the Type IIn category of supernovae are united by the presence of strong multicomponent Balmer emission lines in their spectra, they are quite heterogeneous with respect to other properties such as Balmer line profiles, light curves, strength of radio emission, and intrinsic brightness. We are now beginning to see variety among SNe IIn in their polarimetric characteristics as well, some but not all of which may be due to inclination angle effects. The increasing number of known ""hybrid"" SNe with IIn-like emission lines suggests that circumstellar material may be more common around all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations between spectropolarimetric signatures and other IIn attributes will help us address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.

266,"Near-Infrared Spectra of the Black Hole X-Ray Binary, A0620-00","C.S. Froning, E.L. Robinson, and M.A. Bitner","  We present broadband NIR spectra of A0620-00 obtained with SpeX on the IRTF. The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al. (1994), this gives a precise mass for the black hole in A0620-00 of M_BH = 9.7+-0.6 M_solar. "
267,Automated Generation of Layout and Control for Quantum Circuits,"Mark Whitney, Nemanja Isailovic, Yatish Patel, John Kubiatowicz","  We present a computer-aided design flow for quantum circuits, complete with automatic layout and control logic extraction. To motivate automated layout for quantum circuits, we investigate grid-based layouts and show a performance variance of four times as we vary grid structure and initial qubit placement. We then propose two polynomial-time design heuristics: a greedy algorithm suitable for small, congestion-free quantum circuits and a dataflow-based analysis approach to placement and routing with implicit initial placement of qubits. Finally, we show that our dataflow-based heuristic generates better layouts than the state-of-the-art automated grid-based layout and scheduling mechanism in terms of latency and potential pipelinability, but at the cost of some area.

268,Modeling the Spectral Energy Distribution and Variability of 3C 66A   during the WEBT campaign of 2003 -- 2004,M. Joshi and M. Boettcher,"  The BL Lac object 3C 66A was observed in an extensive multiwavelength monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day time scales. "
269,The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets. X. A m sin i = 11   Mearth planet around the nearby spotted M dwarf GJ 674,"X. Bonfils, M. Mayor, X. Delfosse, T. Forveille, M. Gillon, C.   Perrier, S. Udry, F. Bouchy, C. Lovis, F. Pepe, D. Queloz, N. C. Santos and   J.-L. Bertaux","  Context: How planet properties depend on stellar mass is a key diagnostic of planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars. Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5 dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days. Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level) magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary system. "
270,An individual based model with global competition interaction:   fluctuations effects in pattern formation,"E. Brigatti, V. Schwammle and Minos A. Neto","  We present some numerical results obtained from a simple individual based model that describes clustering of organisms caused by competition. Our aim is to show how, even when a deterministic description developed for continuum models predicts no pattern formation, an individual based model displays well defined patterns, as a consequence of fluctuations effects caused by the discrete nature of the interacting agents.

271,A Comparison between Anomalous 6-cm H$_2$CO Absorption and CO(1-0)   Emission in the L1204/S140,"Monica Ivette Rodriguez, Tommy Wiklind, Ronald J. Allen, Vladimir   Escalante, and Laurent Loinard","  We report observations of the dust cloud L1204 with the Onsala 25-m telescope in the 6 cm (1$_{11}-1_{10}$) transition of \htco. The observed region includes the   S140 H${\alpha}$ arc. This spectral line is seen here in absorption against the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements. The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than the H$_2$CO 6 cm line. On the other hand, formaldehyde is more easily photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas located immediately behind Photon Dominated Regions. "
272,Dimers on surface graphs and spin structures. II,"David Cimasoni, Nicolai Reshetikhin","  In a previous paper, we showed how certain orientations of the edges of a graph G embedded in a closed oriented surface S can be understood as discrete spin structures on S. We then used this correspondence to give a geometric proof of the Pfaffian formula for the partition function of the dimer model on G. In the present article, we generalize these results to the case of compact oriented surfaces with boundary. We also show how the operations of cutting and gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum field theory on surface graphs. "
273,"New version announcement for TaylUR, an arbitrary-order diagonal   automatic differentiation package for Fortran 95",Georg M. von Hippel,"  We present a new version of TaylUR, a Fortran 95 module to automatically compute the numerical values of a complex-valued function's derivatives with respect to several variables up to an arbitrary order in each variable, but excluding mixed derivatives. The new version fixes a potentially serious bug in the code for exponential-related functions that could corrupt the imaginary parts of derivatives, as well as being compatible with a wider range of compilers.

274,Mapping radii of metric spaces,George M. Bergman (U.C.Berkeley),"  It is known that every closed curve of length \leq 4 in R^n (n>0) can be surrounded by a sphere of radius 1, and that this is the best bound. Letting S denote the circle of circumference 4, with the arc-length metric, we here express this fact by saying that the ""mapping radius"" of S in R^n is 1.   Tools are developed for estimating the mapping radius of a metric space X in a metric space Y. In particular, it is shown that for X a bounded metric space, the supremum of the mapping radii of X in all convex subsets of normed metric spaces is equal to the infimum of the sup norms of all convex linear combinations of the functions d(x,-): X --> R (x\in X).   Several explicit mapping radii are calculated, and open questions noted. "
275,A New Model For The Loop-I (The North Polar Spur) Region,M. Wolleben,"  The North Polar Spur (NPS) is the brightest filament of Loop I, a large circular feature in the radio continuum sky. In this paper, a model consisting of two synchrotron emitting shells is presented that reproduces large-scale structures revealed by recent polarization surveys. The polarized emission of the NPS is reproduced by one of these shells. The other shell, which passes close to the Sun, gives rise to polarized emission towards the Galactic poles. It is proposed that X-ray emission seen towards the NPS is produced by interaction of the two shells. Two OB-associations coincide with the centers of the shells. A formation scenario of the Loop I region is suggested. "
276,Leray numbers of projections and a topological Helly type theorem,Gil Kalai and Roy Meshulam,"  Let X be a simplicial complex on the vertex set V. The rational Leray number L(X) of X is the minimal d such that the rational reduced homology of any induced subcomplex of X vanishes in dimensions d and above. Let \pi be a simplicial map from X to a simplex Y, such that the cardinality of the preimage of any point in |Y| is at most r. It is shown that L(\pi(X)) \leq r L(X)+r-1. One consequence is a topological extension of a Helly type result of Amenta. "
277,q-Deformed spin foam models of quantum gravity,"Igor Khavkine, J. Daniel Christensen","  We numerically study Barrett-Crane models of Riemannian quantum gravity. We have extended the existing numerical techniques to handle q-deformed models and arbitrary space-time triangulations. We present and interpret expectation values of a few selected observables for each model, including a spin-spin correlation function which gives insight into the behaviour of the models. We find the surprising result that, as the deformation parameter q goes to 1 through roots of unity, the limit is discontinuous. "
278,HI velocity dispersion in NGC 1058,A. O. Petric and M. P. Rupen,"  We present excellent resolution and high sensitivity Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the 21cm HI line emission from the face-on galaxy NGC 1058, providing the first reliable study of the HI profile shapes throughout the entire disk of an external galaxy. Our observations show an intriguing picture of the interstellar medium; throughout this galaxy velocity-- dispersions range between 4 to 15 km/sec but are not correlated with star formation, stars or the gaseous spiral arms. The velocity dispersions decrease with radius, but this global trend has a large scatter as there are several isolated, resolved regions of high dispersion. The decline of star light with radius is much steeper than that of the velocity dispersions or that of the energy in the gas motions. "
279,Common Envelope Evolution Redux,Ronald F. Webbink (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign),"  Common envelopes form in dynamical time scale mass exchange, when the envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

281,On Punctured Pragmatic Space-Time Codes in Block Fading Channel,"Samuele Bandi, Luca Stabellini, Andrea Conti and Velio Tralli",  This paper considers the use of punctured convolutional codes to obtain pragmatic space-time trellis codes over block-fading channel. We show that good performance can be achieved even when puncturation is adopted and that we can still employ the same Viterbi decoder of the convolutional mother code by using approximated metrics without increasing the complexity of the decoding operations. 
282,On the Markov trace for Temperley--Lieb algebras of type $E_n$,R.M. Green,"  We show that there is a unique Markov trace on the tower of Temperley--Lieb type quotients of Hecke algebras of Coxeter type $E_n$ (for all $n \geq 6$). We explain in detail how this trace may be computed easily using tom Dieck's calculus of diagrams. As applications, we show how to use the trace to show that the diagram representation is faithful, and to compute leading coefficients of certain Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials. "

Sadowski, Marek Potemski, Gerard Martinez","  Graphene multilayers are grown epitaxially on single crystal silicon carbide. This system is composed of several graphene layers of which the first layer is electron doped due to the built-in electric field and the other layers are essentially undoped. Unlike graphite the charge carriers show Dirac particle properties (i.e. an anomalous Berry's phase, weak anti-localization and square root field dependence of the Landau level energies). Epitaxial graphene shows quasi-ballistic transport and long coherence lengths; properties which may persists above cryogenic temperatures. Paradoxically, in contrast to exfoliated graphene, the quantum Hall effect is not observed in high mobility epitaxial graphene. It appears that the effect is suppressed due to absence of localized states in the bulk of the material.Epitaxial graphene can be patterned using standard lithography methods and characterized using a wide array of techniques. These favorable features indicate that interconnected room temperature ballistic devices may be feasible for low dissipation high-speed nanoelectronics. "

Saz Parkinson (Milagro Collaboration),"  Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) have been detected at GeV energies by EGRET and models predict emission at > 100 GeV. Milagro is a wide field (2 sr) high duty cycle (> 90 %) ground based water Cherenkov detector that records extensive air showers in the energy range 100 GeV to 100 TeV. We have searched for very high energy emission from a sample of 106 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) detected since the beginning of 2000 by BATSE, BeppoSax, HETE-2, INTEGRAL, Swift or the IPN. No evidence for emission from any of the bursts has been found and we present upper limits from these bursts. "
287,Specific heat and bimodality in canonical and grand canonical versions   of the thermodynamic model,"G. Chaudhuri, S. Das Gupta","  We address two issues in the thermodynamic model for nuclear disassembly. Surprisingly large differences in results for specific heat were seen in predictions from the canonical and grand canonical ensembles when the nuclear system passes from liquid-gas co-existence to the pure gas phase. We are able to pinpoint and understand the reasons for such and other discrepancies when they appear. There is a subtle but important difference in the physics addressed in the two models. In particular if we reformulate the parameters in the canonical model to better approximate the physics addressed in the grand canonical model, calculations for observables converge. Next we turn to the issue of bimodality in the probability distribution of the largest fragment in both canonical and grand canonical ensembles. We demonstrate that this distribution is very closely related to average multiplicities. The relationship of the bimodal distribution to phase transition is discussed. "
288,Vortex proliferation in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a   two-dimensional lattice of Bose-Einstein condensates,"V. Schweikhard, S. Tung, and E. A. Cornell","  We observe the proliferation of vortices in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless regime on a two-dimensional array of Josephson-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates. As long as the Josephson (tunneling) energy J exceeds the thermal energy T, the array is vortex-free. With decreasing J/T, vortices appear in the system in ever greater numbers. We confirm thermal activation as the vortex formation mechanism and obtain information on the size of bound vortex pairs as J/T is varied. "
289,The core binary fractions of star clusters from realistic simulations,"Jarrod R. Hurley, Sverre J. Aarseth, Michael M. Shara","  We investigate the evolution of binary fractions in star clusters using N-body models of up to 100000 stars. Primordial binary frequencies in these models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time -- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase (occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial binary content of globular clusters. "
290,Approaching the Heisenberg limit in an atom laser,"M. Jeppesen, J. Dugu\'e, G. R. Dennis, M. T. Johnsson, C. Figl, N. P.   Robins and J. D. Close","  We present experimental and theoretical results showing the improved beam quality and reduced divergence of an atom laser produced by an optical Raman transition, compared to one produced by an RF transition. We show that Raman outcoupling can eliminate the diverging lens effect that the condensate has on the outcoupled atoms. This substantially improves the beam quality of the atom laser, and the improvement may be greater than a factor of ten for experiments with tight trapping potentials. We show that Raman outcoupling can produce atom lasers whose quality is only limited by the wavefunction shape of the condensate that produces them, typically a factor of 1.3 above the Heisenberg limit. "
291,A practical Seedless Infrared-Safe Cone jet algorithm,Gavin P. Salam and Gregory Soyez,"  Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any 'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some multi-jet observables.

292,Isospin breaking in the yield of heavy meson pairs in e+e- annihilation   near threshold,"S. Dubynskiy, A. Le Yaouanc, L. Oliver, J.-C. Raynal and M.B. Voloshin","  We revisit the problem of interplay between the strong and the Coulomb interaction in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio for $B {\bar B}$ and $D {\bar D}$ pairs near their respective thresholds in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. We consider here a realistic situation with a resonant interaction in the isospin I=0 channel and a nonresonant strong scattering amplitude in the I=1 state. We find that the yield ratio has a smooth behavior depending on the scattering phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar K}$ production at the $\phi(1020)$ resonance, where the Coulomb effect in the charged-to-neutral yield ratio is generally sensitive to the scattering phases in both the isoscalar and the isovector channels. Furthermore, we apply the same approach to the treatment of the effect of the isotopic mass difference between the charged and neutral mesons and argue that the strong-scattering effects generally result in a modification to the pure kinematical effect of this mass difference.

294,On the number of topological types occurring in a parametrized family of   arrangements,Saugata Basu,"  Let ${\mathcal S}(\R)$ be an o-minimal structure over $\R$, $T \subset \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}$ a closed definable set, and $$ \displaylines{\pi_1: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{k_1 + k_2}, \pi_2: \R^{k_1+k_2+\ell}\to \R^{\ell}, \ \pi_3: \R^{k_1 + k_2} \to \R^{k_2}} $$ the projection maps.   For any collection ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of subsets of $\R^{k_1+k_2}$, and $\z \in \R^{k_2}$, let $\A_\z$ denote the collection of subsets of $\R^{k_1}$, $\{A_{1,\z},..., A_{n,\z}\}$, where $A_{i,\z} = A_i \cap \pi_3^{-1}(\z), 1 \leq i \leq n$. We prove that there exists a constant $C = C(T) > 0,$ such that for any family ${\mathcal A} = \{A_1,...,A_n\}$ of definable sets, where each $A_i = \pi_1(T \cap \pi_2^{-1}(\y_i))$, for some $\y_i \in \R^{\ell}$, the number of distinct stable homotopy types of $\A_\z, \z \in \R^{k_2}$, is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+1)k_2},} $ while the number of distinct homotopy types is bounded by $ \displaystyle{C \cdot n^{(k_1+3)k_2}.} $ This generalizes to the general o-minimal setting, bounds of the same type proved in \cite{BV} for semi-algebraic and semi-Pfaffian families. One main technical tool used in the proof of the above results, is a topological comparison theorem which might be of independent interest in the study of arrangements. "
295,"Generalized Twistor Transform And Dualities, With A New Description of   Particles With Spin, Beyond Free and Massless",Itzhak Bars and Bora Orcal,"  A generalized twistor transform for spinning particles in 3+1 dimensions is constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics. Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper we present the main concepts, and in a companion paper we give other details. "
296,Remnant evolution after a carbon-oxygen white dwarf merger,"Sung-Chul Yoon, Philipp Podsiadlowski and Stephan Rosswog","  We systematically explore the evolution of the merger of two carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent, unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium, be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged). "
297,Direct Theorems in the Theory of Approximation of the Banach Space   Vectors by Entire Vectors of Exponential Type,Ya. Grushka and S.

Obtained results allows to acquire Jackson-type inequalities in many classic spaces of periodic functions and weighted $L_p$ spaces. "
298,Parametrized Post-Newtonian Expansion of Chern-Simons Gravity,Stephon Alexander and Nicolas Yunes,"  We investigate the weak-field, post-Newtonian expansion to the solution of the field equations in Chern-Simons gravity with a perfect fluid source. In particular, we study the mapping of this solution to the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism to 1 PN order in the metric. We find that the PPN parameters of Chern-Simons gravity are identical to those of general relativity, with the exception of the inclusion of a new term that is proportional to the Chern-Simons coupling parameter and the curl of the PPN vector potentials. We also find that the new term is naturally enhanced by the non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the corrections that this new term introduces to the acceleration of point particles and the frame-dragging effect in gyroscopic precession. We find that the Chern-Simons correction to these classical predictions could be used by current and future experiments to place bounds on intrinsic parameters of Chern-Simons gravity and, thus, string theory. "
299,Scaling of Resistance and Electron Mean Free Path of Single-Walled   Carbon Nanotubes,"Meninder Purewal, Byung Hee Hong, Anirudhh Ravi, Bhupesh Chandra,   James Hone, and Philip Kim","  We present an experimental investigation on the scaling of resistance in individual single walled carbon nanotube devices with channel lengths that vary four orders of magnitude on the same sample. The electron mean free path is obtained from the linear scaling of resistance with length at various temperatures. The low temperature mean free path is determined by impurity scattering, while at high temperature the mean free path decreases with increasing temperature, indicating that it is limited by electron-phonon scattering. An unusually long mean free path at room temperature has been experimentally confirmed. Exponentially increasing resistance with length at extremely long length scales suggests anomalous localization effects. "
